My name is Yu Xiulan. I owned three properties in Binhu District, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province: my original home at No. 45 in Yong'an Village of Huazhuang Subdistrict, a newly constructed villa (temporarily numbered 45-1), and a productive pig farm measuring 343.7 square meters. I also held four mu (2,667 square meters) of contracted farmland, with half explicitly guaranteed under a "thirty-year unchanged"  contract. To this day, I still possess all the relevant contracts, property deeds, and keys—none of which I ever surrendered to the demolition authorities.

Each of my three properties occupied distinct locations: the new villa was built on Datong Road, the old house was in old Huazhuang Village, and the pig farm was situated in the silkworm fields on my farmland. The authorities forcibly seized these properties in three separate instances, yet when it came time to determine the resettlement compensation, they tried to lump them together as a single case. The new villa, spanning over 300 square meters and furnished with top quality materials, was built with the intention of preparing for my son’s marriage. We had invested all our savings and even borrowed tens of thousands of yuan to construct it. My son suffered from a devastating bout of nephritis when he was 15 and only began to recover at 20. Due to his illness, he could not find a wife. “Mom, Dad,” he once said, “we make our living raising, slaughtering, and selling pigs. The savings we deplete for the new house will build back, but a nice house will help me find a wife.” The village commune, taking pity on us after my son’s illness, granted us permission to establish a pig farm on my contracted land, allowing my son and me to raise pigs together. Over eight years, we built into a thriving operation with 178 pigs by the time of the forced demolition. Raising so many pigs was bitter work. My son managed the farm during daylight hours while I gathered feed scraps. We worked tirelessly, and my husband also worked himself to exhaustion at his factory job. Despite all our efforts and sacrifices, we never got to spend even a single night in our new villa before it was robbed from us.

The first blow came in October 2002, immediately after we completed the villa. Officials from both our village and subdistrict arrived with demolition notices, but without any legitimate documents or proper procedures. When my husband and I refused to comply, they brought in two local “qingtou”  (thugs) and an appraisal company. The so-called appraisal was less than perfunctory—they barely glanced around the property before making the assessment. By 2003, their tactics had escalated. The demolition team, working in concert with village officials and the thugs cosplaying local “enforcers”, began a systematic campaign to force residents into submission.

My husband wasn’t born in the countryside. He had taken over his father’s factory job at 18 to feed his family after his father passed away. As a result, he didn’t understand the complex rural land policies and ownership structures. On Sunday, March 29, 2003, he had a day off from work, the village officials summoned him shortly after lunch at 1 p.m. My son had tried to stop him from going, fearing something bad would happen, but my husband went anyway. 

At 9 p.m. that evening, after finishing my work at the pig farm, I grew increasingly uneasy and asked my son-in-law to drive me to the village office. I feared they might coerce my husband into signing something. When we arrived, the village party secretary , the head of the village, and the agricultural officer were guarding the entrance and wouldn’t let me in. I had no choice but to return home, leaving my husband in their custody. When he finally returned at midnight, he was broken. “I had no choice. I had to sign.” Overcome with shame and despair, he sobbed continuously and repeatedly slapped himself in the face.

I asked him, “How did this happen?” He described how the village accountant—a tall and physically imposing man—had bodily lifted him onto the signing table. The party secretary, village head, and the accountant surrounded him while someone from the demolition office repeatedly slammed the table, shouting, “If you don’t sign today, you won’t even get a penny tomorrow!” My husband eventually signed an agreement after enduring 11 hours of physical and psychological intimidation including pushing, shoving, and yelling. Notably, the agreement was blank , and my husband wasn’t even the legal property owner.

Later, a demolition officer told my son, “Your house is the best-built one in the area, but they’re offering you practically nothing. Don't you have any connections—someone who understands the inner workings of resettlement—to help you get fair compensation?” But we had no such connections, no insider knowledge. When my son finally learned the details of the compensation, the numbers were staggering in their inadequacy: our new villa, over 300 square meters of quality construction, was valued at a mere ¥166,000 ($22,952); the 343.7-square-meter pig farm that sustained our family was valued at just over ¥30,000 ($4,148); and our old house, approximately 300 square meters, built with earnings from eight years of my tofu-making business, was only compensated at ¥89,900 ($12,430). I worked tirelessly day-and-night to renovate this house, and it had been the site of my eldest daughter’s wedding after its completion and beam-raising. 

The revelation of these numbers broke something in my son. When he learned how they had devalued everything we’ve built, he lost all control, running wildly through the fields in a manic state. He eventually ran away from home, disappearing for several days, and even made two desperate trips to Nanjing that we only learned about later. 

Meanwhile, I was left alone to tend to the pigs and to manage our crumbling household. On April 2, 2003, while I was out running errands, they forcibly demolished our old house and pillaged our home. They pried up floorboards, scattered our pots, pans, and cooking utensils across the yard, and stole anything of value from the house. My husband was away petitioning  the authorities, my son was still missing, and my two daughters were out searching for their brother at train stations. Left alone without any help, I went to the demolition office to demand an explanation. I asked, “Why did you destroy my house when I didn’t sign anything? I still hold the deed and keys!” They responded with cold indifference: “Your husband signed an agreement. That’s enough.”

When my husband returned home to the ruins of our house, he was so distraught that he attempted to take his own life. Thankfully, my daughters finally located my son and convinced him to return home to assuage his father. Though finally reunited, with nowhere else to go, our family of three was forced to move into our pig pen.

Life in the pig pen tested the limits of human endurance. My husband and son had to climb utility poles to siphon electricity—a perilous practice that filled me with dread. We used well water initially but soon had to fetch river water with shoulder yolks. To drive us out, the authorities dug three enormous trenches—each as deep as a moat—around our land. The pig feed we bought from neighboring villages could no longer be carried into our farm; we had to dump them in the nearby fields. One day, a kindhearted worker from a nearby construction site helped us fill one of the trenches, creating a makeshift path so I could sell pork at the market the following morning. That very night, a gang of thugs returned with bulldozers and destroyed the path. Under such dire conditions, our pigs began dying one by one—some from starvation and others from disease. Mosquitoes and flies made sleep nearly impossible, and the suffocating heat only intensified the sickening stench of death.

Not long after destroying our old house, the demolition office staff arrived at the pig farm hoping to fill out the blank agreement my husband was forced to sign. Standing at the entrance, the worker refused to step inside. "The moment I step inside, I’m overwhelmed by the smell of pigs and death. I can’t stand it." The weather was getting hotter, our basic amenities were completely stripped away in the siege, the dead pigs were decomposing where they fell, and flies were swarming in the air. Left with no choice, we fled the pig farm to my youngest daughter’s home. As soon as we left, the demolition crew immediately issued forced demolition notices for both the pig farm and villa. They brought in excavators and bulldozed everything—burying our surviving pigs alive alongside the dead beneath the rubble. It was the final blow to our livelihood.

Between April and May, temperatures soared to 38 to 40 °C (100-104 °F). My son and I made six desperate trips to the Wuxi Agricultural Company’s appraisal office to challenge our property valuations. I asked, “Why was our newly built villa appraised at the same rate as an old house and compensated so poorly?” The appraisal manager admitted, “The appraisal originally classified it as a villa, but the village thugs later tampered with it.” He offered to help correct the appraisal and arranged a meeting with the village head for reassessment. However, the village head immediately dispatched thugs to block the appraisal team, threatening them and preventing any changes from being made. Before being forced to leave, the appraisal manager advised me, “Your old house has both a land certificate and title deed, but they excluded the area from calculations. Your new villa’s appraisal has been manipulated. You should take legal action. Also, given your son’s health issues and recent unemployment due to the demolitions, they should provide him with work.” Following his guidance, I obtained two certifications from the village committee granting two storefronts for my son—a promise that remains unfulfilled to this day.

Desperate and running out of options, I began making regular appeals to Binhu District Party Secretary Dai Jieping, often waiting outside his home. His elderly mother, who lived with him, offered me compassion: “You must not give up on life. You must stay strong. Keep appealing step by step, eventually someone will listen to reason.” I also submitted my petitions to Wuxi Municipal Party Secretary Mao Xiaoping, the People’s Congress Director, and Secretary Dai himself. Although each level issued directives, local officials simply ignored them. Even when I escalated my case to the provincial level and requested information disclosure , the resulting provincial directives met the same fate. This experience revealed to me how thoroughly corruption could override the law.

On July 28, 2003, while we were temporarily living at my daughter’s home, we were informed at dawn that our villa was being demolished. My husband and I rushed to the site to find our meticulously built house being torn apart. The village head had long coveted the villa’s four large gates. By the time we arrived, his men had already dismantled the gates, loaded them onto a truck, and taken them to replace the gates of his own house. There were at least a dozen people at the site, but I was too overwhelmed to count. My husband stood by the site, weeping helplessly. After watching in despair for a while, we could do nothing but leave.

In 2005, I decided to seek justice through legal channels, placing my trust in lawyer Wu Xiliang from the Helie Law Firm on Qingshi Road in Donggang. "You will win this case," he assured me, leading me to borrow ¥20,000 ($2,765) from my in-laws for his services. However, it turned out that Attorney Wu had colluded with the local court, producing a perverse judgment that named my husband as the defendant based on his coerced signature. The court ruling not only validated the forced demolition but erased all our claims to the old house, pig farm, and farmland.

The first court hearing was scheduled right when my husband was hospitalized after a stroke. After 26 days in the hospital, he had just been discharged and was still paralyzed on one side. Unable to attend the hearing, the court ruled against us, dismissing our case claiming we had "no valid reason for absence." This incident completely shattered my son’s trust in the legal system. He declared, “The courts will never side with us ordinary people.” My husband, frustrated and angry, lashed out at me, asking, “Why did you even dare to sue the government?” He even fought with me physically and broke everything in our home. Unable to bear the stain, I sought refuge with my sister, whose home lay near Secretary Dai Jieping’s residence. From there, I continued my almost daily vigil outside Dai’s home, still seeking intervention.

In 2008, a second stroke claimed my husband's life when blood vessels ruptured in his brain. After his death, I pressed on, approaching the Binhu District Court for resolution. The presiding judge offered me a meal and advised, “Keep escalating your case to the district and municipal levels. Perhaps someone elsewhere will help compensate you.” I also filed a complaint against Attorney Wu with Beijing’s judiciary, and though the Beijing Judicial Bureau ordered him to pay compensation, his law firm's director—protected by his position in the Binhu District People's Congress—ensured the order was never enforced.

On June 25, 2010, seeking official acknowledgment of our losses, I submitted information disclosure requests about both my demolished houses to the Wuxi Municipal Planning Bureau and Construction Bureau. Their response was shocking: “Your house is not within the planning scope. There is no record of your property.” They suggested that I escalate my case to the provincial level. Armed with this revelation, my son and I began appealing to provincial courts and the People’s Supreme Court. Between 2010 and 2012, I made 18 trips to Beijing in search of justice. In March 2011, I finally obtained a transfer form from the State Petition Bureau to escalate our case. However, petition interceptors sent by Huazhuang Subdistrict caught me and escorted me directly to the Meiyuan Detention Center for 37 days of unlawful detention.

The detention center's cruelty was systematic. They fed me one bowl of porridge daily, which I hurled back at them in protest. After ten days, my daughter managed to find us and visited with fruits and supplements. The staff confiscated everything she brought and immediately transferred me and my son to a new jail. We were moved in the evening, blindfolded and placed in separate cars. We were sent to Xin’an Nanyuan Guesthouse, where the inhumane treatment continued. They removed all protein from our meals and halved my son’s portions before his eyes, forcing us to subsist on meager rations. When we protested—I smashing a chair against the window, my son overturning a table—even the security guards began to sympathize. One guard eventually said, “Swap our food with theirs. We can buy our own. These people will starve to death in here.” After being starved, my teeth ached, and my stomach pain became unbearable, but I was denied medical care. One sympathetic guard took pity on me and spent ¥60 ($8) of his own money to purchase medication from a pharmacy. He said, “none of you dares to help her, I’ll do it, what’s important is saving a life.” I will never forget his act of kindness and humanity.

Three guards rotated in 8-hour shifts to watch me. There was no television, no phone, nothing but empty hours in a bare room. This confinement took a toll on my body and mind. By release, I had suffered two strokes requiring 42 days of hospitalization. I was reduced to skin and bones, barely resembling a living person.

During my detention, they targeted my son, telling him, “Your father is already dead. Your mother might die soon too. Let’s arrange a job for your wife.” Under this manipulation, my son signed their agreement. They promised to arrange a government job for my daughter-in-law, but it was yet another empty promise. Instead, my daughter-in-law received a low-paying position at a property management company, earning only ¥1,200 ($166) monthly which was later increased to ¥1,500 ($207). When the property management company became privatized, my son grew concerned about his wife’s job security and petitioned the district secretary. Their solution was a transfer to headquarters with her annual salary permanently capped at ¥36,000 ($5,000).  They gave my son an ultimatum: either renew the contract or they would “arrange another job” for her. Waiting for this arrangement left her unemployed from July 2021 until November 2023.

They had also promised to allocate my son a rent-free storefront for three years. However, after three years passed, they filed a fraudulent lawsuit against my son demanding over ¥200,000 ($27,653) in rent. The initial agreement they gave my son was merely an unsealed photocopy. My son, wary of their deception tactics, consulted a lawyer and then spent three days camping at their office until the document was properly stamped. In court, when confronted with the official seal, they quickly withdrew their claim.

Despite this small victory, we continue to face relentless legal battles over both my daughter-in-law’s employment and my son’s storefront. Even now, the courts refuse to issue final judgments, offering only interim rulings. As of November 2023, the third round of hearings continues in both Binhu and Liangxi District Courts, with no end in sight.

On August 17, 2004, as my son prepared for his wedding, they assigned him a 60-square-meter resettlement housing unit on the sixth floor. Every year, this unit leaked so heavily that it became almost uninhabitable. As for my own home, which originally spanned 300 square meters, I was given a mere 90-square-meter unit next door, also on the sixth floor. These are among the poorest quality units left in the resettlement housing stock. Nowadays they accuse me: “Why did you accept the resettlement housing if you believed it unjust?” The answer is simple— we had no means of income; renting was financially impossible. With my husband's and my failing health, and my son's impending marriage, we were facing homelessness. 

After securing work for my daughter-in-law, we paused our petitions temporarily. However, my health took a turn for the worse. In 2015, I was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. In 2018, I underwent surgery for a malignant tumor, leaving me partially paralyzed. Recovery was slow, but I eventually regained some mobility. When my son and I resumed our petitions in 2021, my pulmonary embolism relapsed, leading to another month of hospitalization.

My journey to the Supreme Court on August 31, 2023, offered a glimmer of hope when they confirmed that previous court errors could indeed be reexamined. However, the provincial petition office dismissed my case, saying, “Forget everything else. Let’s just settle the pig farm compensation.” They transferred my case locally, where it was once again buried under fabricated documents. 

Since that Supreme Court visit, surveillance around me has intensified. Initially, 8 guards were posted outside my apartment—4 during the day and 4 at night. They turned my hallway into their smoking lounge, throwing cigarette butts everywhere, leaving a foul stench. I pleaded with them, “I have a serious lung condition. Please don’t smoke here.” They ignored me. In January 2024, my pulmonary embolism relapsed, and I had to spend over ¥8,000 ($1,100) on treatment. For 83 days, these thugs stationed outside prevented me from leaving my home. When I tried to check on our 60-square-meter apartment next door that we had rented out, they prevented me from going, restricting me from fulfilling even my landlord responsibilities. 

Although I called the police multiple times, no action was taken. Finally, in desperation, I grabbed the old butcher knife that I used for slaughtering pigs and declared, “I’ll fight you to the death if this continues!” The district police arrived, accusing me of committing a violent crime. I responded, “I’m not the criminal. You are! You’ve stolen everything I own and forced me into this miserable existence.” They later reduced the number of guards to two—one during the day and one at night—but the harassment persists. Even today, coming to this interview, one of them followed me to the bus station, relenting only after I promised to return by nightfall. If I escape to petition higher authorities, the guards would face fines for failing to contain me.

On April 16, 2024, I, along with two other petitioners, both elderly women, left our activists’ gathering spot at “Little Park” and boarded a bus to neighboring city Changzhou’s Long-Distance Bus Station. However, we were followed and intercepted in the public space. Four men came at us, dragging and manhandling me. They left my arms covered in bruises, and the surgical scar from my earlier lung operation was so severely aggravated that the pain kept me awake at night. I’ve been applying medicated patches for almost three months, but the pain hasn’t eased. They punched me in the face so hard that my eye bled, and they grips also left blisters on my body. 

Fortunately, over a dozen taxi drivers waiting near the transit station for passengers intervened to help. One driver used his car to block the two vehicles the thugs were driving while others called the police. When officers arrived, the attackers had the audacity to complain about the taxi drivers obstructing their cars. Once the path cleared, they shoved us into their cars and sped off. If not for the courage of those drivers, I might not have survived the ordeal.

Among our captors was a young man who was freshly discharged from the military. During the drive back to Wuxi, his hands were trembling as he said, “I just finished my service and joined Huazhuang Subdistrict. I didn’t know I’d be doing something like this. Why are we making ordinary citizens suffer? I don’t want this job anymore—I’m resigning as soon as I get back.” True to his word, I’ve never seen him at the Huazhuang police station again.

The assault also left me with permanent joint damage in my left leg. Doctors suggested genetic testing and possibly administering molecularly targeted therapy, but the test alone would cost ¥20,000 ($2,765), far beyond my means. I told the doctors, “It’s too expensive. If I must die, I’ll make one last stand—I’ll crawl to Beijing and die at Tiananmen Square.”

A few days after the incident on April 20, 2024, while we were attempting to file a police report, over ten men attacked us again and dragged us into a car. Near the public security bureau, riot police surrounded us. One of the women had her head repeatedly slammed against the car door until it swelled severely, and her arms and hands were covered in bruises. They seized her phone and erased all the photos she had taken of our attackers.

We were then taken to the Huazhuang Police Station and separated into holding cells for criminals. They detained us until late at night, accusing us of “disrupting public order” and forcing us to admit to fabricated charges of “obstructing official duties.” The following day, they coerced us into providing fingerprints. Four men surrounded me, forcing my hand onto an ink pad for fingerprints, wiping it clean between impressions. Outnumbered four to one, I had no choice but to submit.

On April 23, 2024, during our official petition reception day, they tried to block me from attending. I prepared to leave my apartment at 1:30 p.m., but the guards at my door received orders to delay me until 2 p.m. When I finally arrived at the office of the Political and Legal Affairs Secretary, I was directed downstairs to the Petition Office. Within minutes, six riot police officers appeared, lifted me by my arms and legs, and again carried me to the Huazhuang police station. I protested, “I can walk on my own,” but was ignored. At the police station, over ten officers surrounded me, trying to force me to record a confession. I resisted until my son arrived and demanded to see their summons documents, accusing them of illegal detention and coercing confessions. They had no choice but to release me. I fled to my sister’s home for refuge, but by 1 a.m., six riot police tracked us down. Recognizing the danger, my brother-in-law and sister called my son-in-law, who rushed over to take me to my daughter’s house. The next morning, when my daughter opened the door, she was horrified to find four people sleeping at the doorstep, still monitoring me.

They deny me even life’s most basic dignities, refusing to reinstate my rural medical insurance. As a result, every hospital visit is an out-of-pocket expense, adding to my already dire financial burden.

I have no farmland, no pigs, and no proper home. My husband worked tirelessly for 43 years but suffered two strokes due to the violence of forced demolitions and died after only receiving a few months of retirement benefits. My son’s health is poor, and our financial situation is beyond precarious. Still, I refuse to give up. Every day, I write in my diary, building my only remaining weapon—the truth. I write with the hope that one day, the truth will come to light, and justice will prevail.

我叫郁秀兰，在江苏省无锡市滨湖区华庄街道永安村拥有三处房产：原居住地45号，一栋新建的别墅（临时编号为45-1），以及一个面积为343.7平方米的生产性猪场。此外，我还有四亩（合2,667平方米）承包地，其中两亩是合同明确规定"三十年不变"的。至今，所有相关合同、房产证和钥匙都完好地保存在我手中，从未交给拆迁部门。

我的三栋房子不在一个地块：新建别墅在大通路上，老房子在老华庄村内，猪场则设在我承包地的桑田里。政府分三次强行征收这些房产，但在确定安置补偿时却要求一并处理。新建的别墅超过300平方米，用料考究，是专门为我儿子成家准备的。为了建这座房子，我们不仅投入了全部积蓄，还借了数万元。我儿子从十五岁就患上了严重的肾炎，直到二十岁才开始康复。因为这场病，他一直找不到对象。他曾对我们说："爸妈，我们靠养猪、杀猪、卖肉为生，钱总能再挣来，但房子我们造好一些，讨老婆容易一些。"公社考虑到我儿子的病情照顾我们一家，批准我们在承包地上建了猪场，让我们母子一起经营。八年间，我们猪场已经上了规模，到被强拆时已经养到了178头猪。两个人养这么多猪是极其辛苦的，儿子负责白天照料猪场，我去收集剩菜剩饭做猪食，我们都干到精疲力尽，我丈夫在工厂里也是累得要死。这座我们付出如此多心血的新房子，我们却一晚都没能住进去就被抢走了。

2002年10月，我的新房刚刚建好，村里和街道的人就通知我们要拆迁。然而，他们没有任何合法文件或手续。我和丈夫拒绝拆迁，他们就找来了村里的两个“青头”（地痞流氓）和一家评估公司。他们当时走走看看，敷衍了事，根本没有进行正式评估。到了2003年，他们的手段变得更加强硬。拆迁队伍与村干部和这些冒充执法人员的地痞勾结在一起，开始系统性地施压，迫使村民就范。

我丈夫并非农村人，他十八岁时父亲去世了，他便顶替父亲进厂工作，承担起养家的责任。正因如此，他对农村的土地政策和产权制度并不了解。2003年3月29日星期天，他难得在家休息。下午一点刚吃完午饭，村里人就把他叫走了。我儿子有不祥的预感，试图劝阻他不要去，但他还是去了。

当晚九点，我在猪场忙完活儿后，心里越发不安，就拜托小女婿开车送我去村里。我担心他们会逼迫我丈夫签字。到了那里，村支书、村长和大队农具员三人拦在门口，不让我进去。我无奈只能回家，而我丈夫还被关在里面。直到午夜，他终于回来了，但整个人都崩溃了。"我实在没办法，不得不签了。"他羞愧绝望得一边痛哭一边不停地打自己耳光。

我追问他："到底怎么会签的？"他描述说，村里的会计——一个身材高大魁梧的男人——直接把他抱起来按到签字的桌子上。大队书记、村长和会计围在他周围，还有一个拆迁办的黑道场的人把桌子拍得砰砰响。他们恐吓我丈夫说："今天不签字，明天一分钱补偿都没有！" 在经历了长达11个小时的肢体和精神胁迫，包括推搡、恐吓和喝斥之后，我丈夫最终在协议上签了字。更荒谬的是，那份协议是空白的，而且我丈夫根本就不是合法的产权人。

后来，一个拆迁办的人对我儿子说："你家的房子是这片区域建得最好的，可赔偿却几乎等于没有。你能不能找懂行（熟悉拆迁内部运作）的人重新改一改，帮你们争取到合理的补偿？”但我们没有门路，没有办法。后来，我儿子去了解细节，补偿少得令人震惊：我们超过300平方米、用料上乘的新别墅，仅被估价16.6万元；那个养活我们全家、面积达343.7平方米的猪场，只补偿了3万多元；而我们约300平方米的老房子，这个靠我八年来做豆制品生意——卖素鸡、百叶等辛苦积攒钱盖起来的房子，竟然只补偿了8.99万元。这座老房子凝聚着我日日夜夜的心血，在它建成上梁之后，我还在那里嫁出了我的大女儿。

当得知这些数字后，我儿子精神几乎崩溃。看到我们辛苦建立的一切被如此贬值，他完全失去了理智，在田里到处乱跑。后来居然离家出走，失踪了好几天，后来我们才知道他还跑到南京去了两次，真的是痴狂了。

与此同时，我一个人要照顾这么多猪，还要维持摇摇欲坠的家。2003年4月2日，趁我出门做生意的时候，他们强行拆除了我们的老房子，洗劫了我们的家。房子的楼板被撬走，锅碗瓢盆扔得满院子都是，家里任何值钱的东西也被偷得一干二净。我丈夫已经去上访了，儿子离家出走还没有回来，两个女儿正在各个火车站寻找弟弟。我一个人孤立无援，只好去拆迁办讨说法。我质问："我没有在任何文件上签字，房产证和钥匙都还在我手上，你们凭什么拆我的房子？"他们冷漠地回答："你老头子签字了，这事就定了，没用了。"

我丈夫回来后，看到家被拆，绝望得试图自杀。幸好，我女儿终于打通了儿子的电话，用父亲的情况劝他回了家。家没了，我们一家三口只能搬到猪场里住。

猪场的生活考验着人类忍耐的极限。我丈夫和儿子不得不爬上电线杆偷电——这种危险的行为让我充满恐惧。我们一开始用井水，但很快就不得不用扁担去河里挑水。为了赶我们走，当局在我们的土地周围挖了三条巨大的沟渠，每一条都深如护城河。我们从邻村买来的猪食无法运进农场，只能倒在附近的田里。有一天，附近工地的一个好心工人帮我们填平了一条沟，为我第二天早上去市场卖猪肉开辟了一条临时通道。但就在当天晚上，一伙地痞带着推土机又把这条路给毁了。在这种恶劣的条件下，我们的猪开始一只接一只地死去——有的是饿死的，有的是病死的。蚊虫苍蝇让我们无法入睡，而闷热的天气更加剧了令人作呕的死亡气息。

在拆毁我们的老房子不久后，拆迁办的工作人员来到猪场，想要填写我丈夫被迫签下的那份空白协议。站在入口处，那个工作人员拒绝进入。"我一踏进去就被猪和死亡的气味淹没，我受不了。"天气越来越热，在这种围困中我们所有的基本设施都被剥夺了，死去的猪就地腐烂，苍蝇在空中成群。我们别无选择，只好逃到小女儿家。我们一离开，拆迁队就立即对猪场和别墅下达了强制拆迁通知。他们开来挖掘机，推平了一切——把我们活着的猪和死去的猪一起埋在了废墟之下。这是对我们生计的最后一击。

2003年4月到5月初，无锡的天气炎热，气温高达38到40度。我和儿子跑了六次无锡农业有限公司的评估公司，质问他们："为什么把我们全新的别墅按老房子的标准评估，只赔偿十几万元？"评估公司的经理起初告诉我，评估报告中确实写的是"别墅"，但后来被村里的地痞流氓篡改了。他愿意帮我们更正，于是与村长约定了时间重新评估。没想到，村长立刻安排一些地痞流氓守在那里，威胁评估公司的人，不许帮我改正结果。离开时，评估公司的经理对我说："你的老房子有土地证和产权证，却不给算面积，产权人没有签字，新房弄成这样，你应该去起诉。还有你儿子身体不好、没有工作，应该叫他们给他安排工作。"听了他的话，我到大队开了两张证明，申请给儿子批两间店面，可这件事至今没有落实。

走投无路的我开始定期向滨湖区区委书记戴解平上访，经常在他家门外等候。他与他同住的年迈母亲对我表示同情："你不能放弃生命。你必须坚强。要一步一步地上访，总会有人听取道理的。"我还向无锡市委书记毛小平、人大主任和戴书记本人提交了请愿书。虽然每个层级都下达了指示，但地方官员置之不理。即使我将案件升级到省级并要求信息公开，省级指示的结果也是同样的命运。这段经历向我揭示了腐败如何彻底凌驾于法律之上。

2003年7月28日，当我们暂住在女儿家时，天刚亮就收到通知说我们的别墅正在被拆除。我和丈夫赶到现场，发现我们精心建造的房子正在被拆得支离破碎。村长一直觊觎别墅的四扇大门。等我们到达时，他的人已经拆下了大门，装上卡车，运去替换他自己房子的大门。现场至少有十几个人，但我过于震惊，无法数清。我丈夫站在现场，无助地哭泣。绝望地看了一会后，我们只能离开。

2005年，我决定通过法律途径寻求正义，将信任托付给东港青石路河埒律师事务所的吴锡良律师。"你这个案子一定能赢，"他向我保证，这让我向亲家母借了两万元聘请他的服务。然而，事实证明吴律师与当地法院串通一气，根据我丈夫被逼迫的签字做出了一个荒谬的判决，将我丈夫列为被告。法院的判决不仅认可了强制拆迁，还否定了我们对老房子、猪场和农田的所有权利主张。

第一次开庭恰逢我丈夫因中风住院。在医院住了二十六天后，他刚出院，还处于半身不遂的状态。因无法出庭，法院以"无正当理由缺席"为由驳回了我们的案件。这件事彻底摧毁了我儿子对法律制度的信任。他说："法院永远不会站在我们老百姓这边！"我丈夫又气又恼，对我发火说："你怎么敢去告政府？"他甚至和我打起来，把家里的东西都砸了。我无法承受这种压力，只好去投靠住在戴解平书记家附近的姐姐。从那里，我继续几乎每天都守候在戴家门外，仍在寻求干预。

2008年，我的丈夫因第二次中风，脑血管破裂去世。在他死后，我继续坚持，向滨湖区法院寻求解决。主审法官给我端来一碗饭菜，建议说："你继续向区里、市里反映，也许其他地方会有人帮你补偿。"我还向北京司法部门投诉了吴律师，虽然北京司法局下令他赔偿，但他所在律师事务所的主任——借助其滨湖区人大代表的职位——确保这个命令从未得到执行。

2010年6月25日，为寻求对我们损失的官方承认，我向无锡市规划局和建设局提交了关于我两处被拆房屋的信息公开申请。他们的回复令人震惊："你的房子不在规划范围内。没有你的房产记录。"他们建议我将案件升级到省级。有了这个发现，我和儿子开始向省级法院和最高人民法院上诉。从2010年到2012年，我为寻求正义去了北京18次。2011年3月，我终于从国家信访局获得了一份转办单，可以将案件升级。然而，华庄街道派来的截访人员抓住了我，直接把我押送到梅园看守所非法关押了37天。

看守所的残酷是系统性的。他们每天只给我一碗稀粥，我以抗议的方式将粥泼回去。十天后，我女儿设法找到我们，带来水果和营养品探视。工作人员没收了她带来的所有东西，随即将我和儿子转移到一个新的拘留所。我们在傍晚被转移，眼睛被蒙上，分别被塞进不同的车里。我们被送到新安南院宾馆，在那里非人道待遇继续。他们从我们的饭菜中去除所有蛋白质，当着我儿子的面将他的饭量减半，迫使我们靠微薄的口粮维生。当我们抗议时——我用椅子砸窗户，我儿子掀翻桌子——连保安都开始同情我们。终于有一个保安说："把我们的饭菜跟他们换。我们可以自己买。这些人会在这里饿死的。"挨饿之后，我牙疼，胃痛难忍，但他们拒绝给我医疗照顾。一个富有同情心的保安可怜我，自掏腰包花了60元在药店买药。他说："你们都不敢帮她，我来帮，救人要紧。"我永远不会忘记他的善举和人性。

三个保安轮流八小时轮班看守我。房间里没有电视，没有电话，只有空荡荡的房间和无尽的时光。这种禁闭严重损害了我的身心。等到释放时，我已经中风两次，需要住院42天。我瘦得只剩皮包骨，几乎不像个活人。

在我被关押期间，他们针对我儿子，告诉他："你父亲已经去世了。你母亲可能也快死了。让我们给你妻子安排个工作吧。"在这种操纵下，我儿子签了他们的协议。他们承诺给我儿媳安排一个政府工作，但这又是一个空头承诺。相反，我儿媳在一家物业管理公司得到了一个低薪职位，每月只挣1,200元，后来增加到1,500元。当物业管理公司私有化时，我儿子担心妻子的工作保障，向区委书记请愿。他们的解决方案是调到总部，但年薪永久限制在36,000元。他们给我儿子下了最后通牒：要么续签合同，要么他们会给她"安排另一份工作"。等待这个安排让她从2021年7月一直失业到2023年11月。

他们还承诺给我儿子分配一个免租三年的店面。然而，三年过后，他们对我儿子提起虚假诉讼，要求支付超过20万元的租金。他们最初给我儿子的协议只是一份未盖章的复印件。我儿子警惕他们的欺骗手段，咨询了律师，然后在他们办公室里蹲守了三天，直到文件被正式盖章。在法庭上，当面对正式印章时，他们迅速撤回了诉讼。

尽管取得这个小胜利，我们仍在为儿媳的就业和儿子的店面继续着不懈的法律斗争。即使到现在，法院也拒绝做出最终判决，只给出临时裁定。截至2023年11月，第三轮听证会在滨湖区和梁溪区法院继续进行，看不到尽头。

2004年8月17日，在我儿子准备结婚时，他们给他分配了一套六楼的60平方米安置房。每年这套房子都漏水严重，几乎无法居住。至于我自己原本300平方米的家，我只得到隔壁一套同样在六楼的90平方米单元。这些都是安置房存量中质量最差的单位。如今他们指责我："如果你认为不公平，为什么要接受安置房？"答案很简单——我们没有收入来源；租房在经济上根本不可能。随着我和丈夫的健康状况恶化，加上儿子即将结婚，我们正面临无家可归的境地。

在为儿媳找到工作后，我们暂时停止了上访。然而，我的健康状况急剧恶化。2015年，我被诊断出肺栓塞。2018年，我因恶性肿瘤做了手术，导致部分瘫痪。康复过程缓慢，但我最终恢复了一些行动能力。当我和儿子在2021年恢复上访时，我的肺栓塞复发，导致又住院一个月。

2023年8月31日，我到最高法院的行程带来了一线希望，他们确认先前法院的错误确实可以重新审查。然而，省信访办驳回了我的案件，说："其他的都别提了。我们就解决猪场的赔偿问题。"他们将我的案件转回地方，在那里又一次被伪造的文件掩埋。

自从那次最高法院访问以来，对我的监视加强了。起初，8个警卫被派驻在我公寓外——白天4个，晚上4个。他们把我的走廊变成了他们的吸烟室，到处扔烟头，留下难闻的臭味。我恳求他们："我有严重的肺病。请不要在这里吸烟。"他们对我置之不理。2024年1月，我的肺栓塞复发，不得不花费超过8,000元治疗。83天里，这些地痞守在外面阻止我离开家。当我试图去查看隔壁我们出租的60平方米公寓时，他们阻止我去，连履行房东责任都不让。

虽然我多次报警，但没有任何行动被采取。最后，在绝望中，我抓起以前杀猪用的老菜刀宣布："如果这样继续下去，我就跟你们拼命！"区警察赶到，指控我犯暴力罪。我回应说："我不是罪犯。你们才是！你们偷走了我的一切，迫使我陷入这种悲惨的境地。"后来他们将警卫减少到两人——白天一个，晚上一个——但骚扰仍在继续。就算是今天来接受采访，他们中的一个也跟着我到公交站，直到我保证天黑前回来才放手。如果我逃脱去向上级部门申诉，这些警卫就会因未能看管我而被罚款。

2024年4月16日，我和其他两位老年女访民从我们在"小公园"的活动据点出发，乘车前往邻市常州的长途汽车站。然而，我们被跟踪并在公共场所被截获。四个男人向我们冲来，拖拽殴打我。他们让我的手臂布满淤青，之前肺部手术的疤痕被严重刺激，疼得我晚上无法入睡。我已经贴了将近三个月的药贴，但疼痛仍未缓解。他们打我脸部打得太重，以至于眼睛出血，他们的掐握也在我身上留下了水泡。

幸运的是，十多位在车站附近等候乘客的出租车司机挺身而出帮助我们。一位司机用他的车挡住那些地痞开的两辆车，其他人则打电话报警。警察到达时，那些施暴者居然还有胆量抱怨出租车司机阻碍他们的车。一旦道路清空，他们就把我们推进车里快速离开。如果不是那些司机的勇气，我可能就没能活着熬过这次磨难。

在抓捕我们的人中有一个刚退伍的年轻人。在返回无锡的路上，他双手发抖地说："我刚退伍就到了华庄街道。我不知道会做这种事。为什么要让老百姓受苦？我不想干这份工作了——一回去我就辞职。"他说到做到，我再也没有在华庄派出所见过他。

这次袭击还给我的左腿留下永久性的关节损伤。医生建议做基因检测，可能需要分子靶向治疗，但仅检测费用就要20,000元，远超出我的经济能力。我告诉医生："太贵了。如果我必须死，我要做最后一搏——我要爬到北京，死在天安门广场。"

2024年4月20日，事发几天后，当我们试图报案时，十多个人再次袭击我们并把我们拖进一辆车。在公安局附近，防暴警察包围了我们。其中一位女士的头部被反复撞击在车门上，肿得很厉害，手臂和手都布满淤青。他们抢走了她的手机，删除了她拍摄的所有施暴者照片。

随后我们被带到华庄派出所，分别关进犯人牢房。他们把我们关到深夜，指控我们"扰乱公共秩序"，强迫我们承认伪造的"妨碍公务"罪名。第二天，他们强迫我们按手印。四个人围着我，强行按着我的手在印泥上按指纹，每按一次就擦干净。以四敌一，我别无选择，只能屈服。

2024年4月23日是信访局接访日，他们试图阻止我参加。我准备下午1:30离开公寓，但门口的警卫接到命令要拖延我到2点。当我终于到达政法委书记办公室时，被指示下楼去信访办。几分钟内，六名防暴警察出现，抬着我的胳膊和腿，再次把我带到华庄派出所。我抗议说："我自己能走，"但被无视。在派出所，十多名警察围着我，试图强迫我录口供。我坚持抵抗，直到我儿子到来，要求查看他们的传唤文件，指控他们非法拘留和强迫供认。他们不得不放我离开。我逃到姐姐家避难，但到凌晨1点，六名防暴警察追踪到我们。意识到危险，我姐夫和姐姐打电话给我女婿，他赶来把我送到女儿家。第二天早上，当我女儿打开门时，她惊恐地发现四个人睡在门口，仍在监视我。

他们连最基本的尊严都不给我，拒绝给我开农村医疗保险转正。我现在住院的一切费用都要自费，加重了已经很重的经济负担。

我没有农田，没有猪，也没有像样的家。我丈夫辛勤工作了43年，却因暴力强拆带来的刺激而两次中风，只领了几个月的退休金就去世了。我儿子的身体也不好，家里的经济十分艰难。尽管如此，我仍然拒绝放弃。我每天坚持写日记，建立起我唯一剩下的武器——真相。我写下这些，希望有一天，真相能大白于天下，正义终将得到声张。
