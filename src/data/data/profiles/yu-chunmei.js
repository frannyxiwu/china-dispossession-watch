I am Yu Chunmei from No. 32-33 Chen Alley, Chunming North Village, Fangqian, Jiangxi Street, Xinwu District, Wuxi City. On April 2, 2007, they forcibly demolished my legal property. Our property had official written approval and permits that no entity had the right to violate. However, they formed a network of collusion — the police station, public security bureau, petition offices, and various departments — all protecting each other, working together to conceal the truth and obstruct justice. They told me, 'Your problem is unsolvable. With the central government in such disarray, do you truly believe anyone will resolve your situation?'

My husband served six years in the military, from Yunnan to Beijing, and our home front door proudly displayed the retired soldier plaque issued by Jiangsu Province. Our village brigade secretary was originally Zhang Weiming (phonetic) and is now Hua Jianliang (phonetic). Because we wouldn’t cooperate with their illegal demolition scheme, they deliberately targeted my family. My husband received absolutely none of the benefits for his six years of military service — not even basic social security or medical insurance — effectively was turned from a 'revolutionary' into a 'counter-revolutionary.' The records in my husband's file were falsified by our brigade secretary Hua Jianliang and accountant Xu Dongsheng (phonetic). When we contested this and applied for reconsideration, the Jiangsu Provincial Veterans Affairs Department simply forwarded our case to the Wuxi Veterans Affairs Bureau, which then passed it to the Xinwu District Veterans Affairs Bureau — an endless cycle of bureaucratic evasion.

During the period of demolition, Xinwu District Party Secretary Gong Beixin (phonetic) reclassified landless farmers' household registrations into categories ineligible for compensation — a deliberate act of political fraud that left us with merely a thousand yuan per month. Our entire family was forced to survive on just my meager landless farmer's allowance of ¥1,100 ($152) monthly, compelling us to scavenge through garbage for survival. If we refused to sign the demolition papers, they would continue to withhold my husband's veterans' compensation. The threats extended to my son — they promised to let him keep his career if we signed, but warned they would imprison him for two years if we refused. My son remained unemployed until late 2021 when, at over 50 years of age, he finally secured a security job paying just over ¥2,000 ($276) monthly.

The demolition office employed numerous intimidation tactics, including sending 4 men in identical white shirts under the cover of darkness to pound on our walls and shatter our windows. One person kept watch, one person below gathered bricks and passed them up, another positioned at height received them, and the last guy stood atop the wall hurling bricks onto our balcony. Our home had just been renovated for our son's wedding, and the shattered glass flew into our interior rooms. These kinds of harassments continued relentlessly. On March 24, 2008, at 1:40 PM, 11 people invaded our home — their eighth such intrusion. I stood beside my husband and said, 'Old man, today we must part ways. They’ve deployed thugs and gangsters.' As he was carried away, five others pursued me. I fled eastward in desperation, suffering a deep laceration to my hand — a scar that reached to the bone — as I leapt to escape. After evading my pursuers, I hid nearby and witnessed them dragging my husband away, a bedsheet wrapped around his neck chocking him. My heart raced with anguish, but I was powerless to intervene. Later, my husband recounted that his captors had confessed to him, 'To be honest, we bear no personal grudge against you — Hua Jianliang and Chen Zhengyang sent us to take you.'

Following this incident, I traveled to the Jiangsu Public Security Bureau in Nanjing to report these crimes. Upon my return, they imprisoned me in the innermost room of the Xingfu Hotel in Fangqian for over three months. My son searched frantically but couldn't locate me, and my husband was still abducted without a trace, his mind went entirely blank. During my captivity, our brigade secretary Zhang Weimin transferred over ¥130,000 ($17,913) in cash from the village’s assets to the Xingfu Hotel owner to maintain my strict confinement. They assigned 26 guards to watch me continuously, day and night. Zhang Weimin physically assaulted me, striking my eye with such force that I nearly lost my vision — I still bear the visible scar — while threatening, 'Today I'll beat you to death.' Throughout my detention, my blood pressure soared to dangerous levels above 180, prompting them to monitor it three to four times daily to ensure I wouldn't die in their custody. I clung desperately to life, motivated by the thought of living to eventually return home and reunite with my children and grandchildren.

During the 2007 forced demolition of our home, all other villagers had already left. I maintained a constant vigil on the third floor of my housr, perpetually alert and braced for their next assault. Under cover of darkness, thugs came to hammer at our walls and demolish our house.

After my husband's abduction, he vanished for 5 agonizing years, narrowly escaping death, until December 31, 2012, when he was finally returned by the Xinwu District police. Throughout this ordeal, security squad leader Hua Jianliang (phonetic), police chief Chen Zhengyang (phonetic), Sun Yuren (phonetic) and others had canceled my husband's household registration for those five years. We had all presumed him dead. Following his kidnapping, they had intended to silence him permanently, but he managed to escape. The vehicle transporting him traveled by the East Sea shore, where his captors were hungry and stopped to eat — drinking exuberantly and playing drinking games. Hearing their revelry, my husband seized this moment to flee. After his escape, he survived by collecting garbage and harvesting river snails in warm weather to get by. He dared not return home or contact me, terrorized by the gangsters' threat: 'If we see you within five years, we'll eliminate your entire family.' Moreover, he had neither money nor phone, while I was subjected to frequent detentions, financially destitute and barely able to sustain myself, let alone search for him. When my husband was eventually returned to the police station, their investigation materials included only 3 black and white headshots of his potential kidnappers. I demanded answers — 11 people had participated in his kidnapping, yet only 3 were documented. What about the thug that came who had a prominent knife scar on his face? They claimed they would investigate, but merely continued their pattern of collusion and concealment.

In 2019, I journeyed to Beijing to report these injustices. Upon my return, 7 people from Jiangxi Street promptly arrested me without explanation and placed me in a detention center — I possess a release certificate documenting this. In 2020, following my brother-in-law's death, I traveled to Beijing for his funeral. I requested permission from our subdistrict community's official Chen Bin, offering, 'If you distrust my intentions and fear I might petition in Beijing, you may send security guards to accompany me.' Startlingly, upon my arrival in Beijing shortly after 11 PM, I was ambushed and robbed of my phone, bag, and identification card. After my brother-in-law's cremation the next day, I personally contacted the Beijing Representative Office of Jiangsu Provincial People's Government on the third day, requesting a meeting and demanding accountability for the robbery. Upon arriving at their office, I was confronted by hired thugs — hale young veterans employed as enforcers. One violently seized my throat, pinched my nose and mouth shut, and dragged me upside-down from the west entrance to the east gate of the Representative Office. Another assailant delivered a powerful blow that brought me to the ground and caused internal bleeding. They stole my phone before escorting me back to the Wuxi Fangqian Police Station. By early dawn of the fourth day, they had vanished without a trace. The police instructed me to wait patiently, informing me that personnel from Wuxi No.2 Detention Center would arrive to take me in. I suffered severe pain from the beating, with injuries to my nose, mouth, and throat — medical evidence of which exists in hospital X-rays. From 2023 to 2024, they repeatedly attempted to lure me to the Fangqian Police Station, where the three thugs who had assaulted me would also be present, seeking to cover up their violence and 'resolve' everything together. I steadfastly refused.

On June 29, 2023, around 3 PM, my husband visited the Veterans Affairs Bureau to collect vouchers when our sub-district community's second-in-command, Director Wang Jianxin, knocked him unconscious with a single punch, fracturing two vertebrae. Wang Jianxin fled immediately after the assault. Despite us having photographic evidence of the incident and filing a police report, the authorities took no action. Years of torment have left my husband emotionally numb, with fragmented memory and deteriorating health. On one occasion when he attempted to report an incident, he was handcuffed and taken to the police station for a body search, trembling uncontrollably with fear. I protested, demanding to know why they were searching him. My husband is a long-standing Communist Party member with 54 years of combined party and military service. My father-in-law was a Korean War veteran. They devoted our lives to protecting our country, yet we cannot protect our own family. I'm currently taking targeted medication that will sustain me for only two to three more years, and my own lifespan is limited. Though I don't have cancer, the internal injuries from their beatings required emergency surgery, and my left lung is now failing.

On February 16, 2024, I traveled to Beijing to report the corrupt officials from Fangqian. After concluding the visit, I called my younger sister. Through surveillance of my phone, they pinpointed my location and apprehended me opposite Beijing South Station, forcibly returning me to an organizational department for case processing on Zhujiang Road, Chunchao Wangzhuang Street in Xinwu District. Immediately upon arrival, they handcuffed both me and another petitioner who went with me, detained us for 24 hours, and employed various coercive methods to extract confessions. As my fingerprints were unclear, they repeatedly stamped my hand six or seven times with a seal, attempting to fabricate evidence and charge me with 'disrupting public order' in Beijing."

我是无锡市新吴区江溪街道坊前春明北村陈巷32-33号的虞春梅。2007年4月2号他们强拆了我的合法房产。我们的房产有白纸黑字的批复和许可，任何单位不能侵犯。然而他们拉帮结派，派出所、公安、信访等各个部门官官相护、互相勾结，一直在掩盖真相，不予解决。他们说，"你这个事情解决不了的，中央都乱成这样，你的事情会有人给你解决吗？"

我丈夫曾经在部队里从云南到北京服役六年，我们家门上都挂着江苏省颁发的退伍军人的牌子。我们村的大队书记本来是张伟明（音译）、现在是华建良（音译），他们因为拆迁的事故意针对我家，我丈夫当六年兵的任何待遇都没有得到，甚至连社保和医保都没有，就是"正革命"打成"反革命"。我丈夫的档案里都是我们大队书记华建良和会计许冬生（音译）做虚假材料。我们不认可、申请复议，江苏省的退役军人事务厅抄送给无锡市退役军人事务局，无锡市又抄送给新吴区退役军人事务局，一直在踢皮球。

拆迁的时候，我们新吴区的失地农民的户口被新吴区党委书记龚北新（音译）转成了不符合补偿条件的户口，这是一起政治舞弊，让我们每个月只能拿到一千多块钱。我们全家只能靠我一个人失地农民每月1100多元的生活费度日，逼得我们只能靠捡垃圾生活。他们威胁我们说如果拆迁不签字就不给我丈夫退伍军人的补偿。他们甚至威胁我的儿子，说如果签字就能保住我儿子的职业，不然就把他送进监狱去，一送进去就是两年。我儿子长期失业没有工作，直到2021年下半年，他一个50多岁的人才找到一个月薪2000多元的保安工作。

拆迁办为了恐吓我动用过很多伎俩，比如四个人穿着统一的白衬衫借着夜色来敲墙壁、砸玻璃。他们一个人望风，一个人在下面捡砖块递上去，一个人站在高处接砖块，还有一个人站在墙头把砖头往我们阳台上扔。我们的房子当时刚刚儿子结婚装修好，玻璃被打破一直飞到房间里面。他们就一直耍这样的手段。2008年3月24号下午1点40分，十一个人来到我家里，这已经是他们第八次来。我在他旁边，我对他说，"老头，今天我们两个人不能在一起了，他们动用了黑社会"。我眼看着他被抬走，我自己也被五个人追赶。我拼命往东边逃，跳出去的时候手上被划开了很长的疤，当时伤口一直深及骨头，甩掉跟踪的人之后我就躲在一边看着他们用床单勒着我丈夫的脖子，拉扯着逼着他走。我当时心里十万火急，但我又能怎么办？只能眼睁睁地看着他被绑走。后来我丈夫回忆，那些绑架他的人对他说，"今天和你老实交代，不是我们要和你过不去，是华建良和陈正央派我们来绑你"。

之后我前往南京的省公安厅举报，回来后他们把我关押在坊前的幸福宾馆的包间里最里面的一层，关了三个多月。我儿子四处找不到我，我丈夫也被绑走不知所踪，他的脑子里都是一片空白。关押期间，我们大队书记张伟民私自调拨十三多万现金的资金打给承包幸福宾馆的大老板，把我死死地看住了。他们派了二十六个人白天黑夜地看守我一个人。甚至张伟民还打了我的眼睛，差点就打瞎了，现在还有明显的留疤，他说"今天我打死你"。被关期间，我血压高达一百八十几，每天他们都要给我量三到四次血压确保我不死在里面。我心想一定要保住自己的性命，因为我还有子孙，想要活着回去和他们团聚。

2007年强拆我们家的时候，我们村上的人已经全部搬走了，我24小时都在三层楼上面守着，随时随地严阵以待准备他们来。黑社会趁着晚上就来动手敲我家的墙壁。

我丈夫被绑架后一共失踪了5年，死里逃生，到2012年12月31日才被新吴区公安送回来。期间我丈夫的户口也被坊前派出所的治安大队长华建良（音译）、派出所所长陈正央（音译）、孙玉仁（音译）等注销了整整五年。我们都以为他已经死了。我丈夫被绑架后，他们本来想灭他的口，但他逃了出来。押运他的车子开到东海边，他们黑帮肚子饿了下车吃饭，还在兴冲冲地喝酒、划拳。我丈夫听见他们吃喝的声音，趁机逃出来。逃出来后他每天捡垃圾，天热的时候摸河里的螺蛳，混一口饭吃。他不敢回家，因为黑帮的人威胁他说，"五年内你要么不给我们看见，看见就把你全家灭掉"，所以他不敢回来，也不敢联系我。一来他没有任何的钱和手机，二来我自己也频繁遭到关押和控制，又没有钱，自顾不暇，没法出去寻找他。我丈夫被送回派出所后，警察调查拿出的材料里只有三个人的黑白人像照片。我质问他们，来绑架的人有十一个，怎么只有三个人的信息？其中一个脸上有刀疤的打手呢？他们嘴上说这个事情他们来调查，但还是继续拉帮结派、层层掩盖。

2019年我到北京去举报，回来后我们江溪街道派来七个人，不问青红皂白就把我关到看守所，我有释放证作为证据。2020年，我的小妹夫病故，我到北京去奔丧。我请求通过我们社区的陈斌（音译）放我去奔丧，对他说"如果你不信任我（害怕我去北京上访）的话，可以叫两个保安跟着我。"谁知我一到北京，晚上11点多钟下车后就有人来抢劫拦截，抢我的手机、包和身份证。第二天我们把我妹夫火化以后，第三天我就亲自打电话给驻京办的领导，请求他接待我、为我被抢劫的事情负责。当我到了驻京办，他们就动用社会上的打手，都是年轻而且身强力壮的退伍军人。其中一个掐了我的喉管，捏着我的鼻子和嘴把我倒着拖出去，从驻京办的西大门拖到了东大门。后面又有一个人冷拳把我打倒，我被打得内出血。他们抢走了我的手机，把我押送回无锡坊前派出所。第四天早上东方刚刚天色发白，他们就逃之夭夭了。派出所的人叫我耐心等待，第二看守所的人会来把我带到监狱去。当时我被打得很痛，他们把我的鼻子和嘴都捏得透不过气，喉管也受伤了，我都有医院里拍片的证据。从2023到2024年，他们试图骗我到坊前派出所，把打我的三个黑社会的打手也叫到现场，要把他们的暴行都一起"解决"了，我不同意。

2023年6月29日下午3点多，我丈夫前往退役军人事务局拿优惠券，被我们社区的第二把手王建新（音译）主任一拳打倒在地上昏死过去，导致两根腰椎骨断裂。王建新打人之后逃逸，我们有现场的照片，报了警但是公安不作为。我丈夫多年来被折磨得人已经麻木了，记忆一片空白，身体也不好。有一次他去举报，被戴上手铐带到派出所搜身，整个人如筛糠一般。我说你们凭什么搜他的身？我丈夫是老共产党员，有54年的党龄军龄，我公公是抗美援朝的军人，他们保护国家，却保不住我们自己一家人。我现在吃着靶向药，这个药最多还能吃两到三年，也就是说我的寿命也快到头了。我没有癌症，被打到内伤后抢救动手术，左边的肺部已经不行了。

2024年2月16号，我到北京去举报坊前的贪官污吏，结束后打电话给我小妹，他们通过监听电话就知道了我的行踪，在北京南站对面抓住了我，把我押回来关到新吴区珠江路春潮旺庄街道的一个审案立案的组织部门。一下车他们就把我和另一个同行的访民双手紧拷，关了24小时，用各种手段强迫我认罪。我的手指上的指纹不清晰，他们就反复六七次用印章反复印在我手上，试图弄出假手印，给我定去北京"捣乱治安"的罪名。
