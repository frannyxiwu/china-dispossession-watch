My name is Bao Hailan, and I come from Baojie Village in Turtle Head Isle, Binhu District, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. I represent 1,256 villagers from three neighboring villages - Baojie, Chongshan, and Dushan - who have been displaced for over 17 years.

It all began innocuously enough. In 2007, the local government announced the "6699 Action" [1], touting it as an ecological restoration project for Taihu Lake. But behind this green facade lurked a sinister plan orchestrated by Wuxi's then Municipal Party Secretary, Yang Weize [2]. His true intent was to seize valuable land from the three Turtle Head Isle villages, and would soon uproot our lives in the most brutal manner.

On December 10, 2007, Yang mobilized Wuxi’s Armed Police Force, sending several buses charging into our villages under his direct command. Villagers who resisted entry to their homes for “assessment” were arrested and escorted to the police station. In pursuit of their own selfish gains, the authorities deployed every tool at their disposal to crush us: all were taken to the police station, some were detained, handcuffed with shackles, hung up and beaten. We have substantial evidence, including video recordings, documenting these brutal methods, but the torture inflicted can only be fully described by those who experienced it firsthand. More than 60 villagers were detained, and around 20 were sent to a detention center, where they were coerced into signing unfair resettlement agreements. The elders among us, who had survived the harrowing Japanese invasion, the Kuomintang's white terror, and the Liberation War, said they had never witnessed such cruelty from a government against its own people.

During this massive show of force, 4,974.9 mu (822 acres) of our three villages’ collective land and nearly 20,000 square meters of other structures were seized without so much as a nod to legal procedures. Our homes, our fields, our very way of life - all absorbed into the newly expanded Turtle Head Isle Scenic Area. This 5A-level scenic park [3] turned into a lucrative “wallet” for the local government, its coffers swelled with ticket sales, parking fees, and other revenues. Dushan Village was repurposed into a Cherry Blossom Valley [4] whose entrance was adorned with a ¥105 ($15) ticket booth. Chongshan Village's lush farmland disappeared under a sea of asphalt; its land converted into parking lots that generate tens of millions in annual revenue. And Baojie? Our fate was the most insulting of all. Seeking to ingratiate himself with China’s central government, particularly with the powerful Zhou Yongkang [5], Yang Weize planned to raise 26 luxury villas where our modest farmhouses once stood to gift to Central Committee members. When this scheme fell through, our village was unceremoniously paved over, becoming nothing more than a road circling the mountain and more parking spaces to disperse the overwhelming influx of visitors. Every income stream lined the pockets of Turtle Head Isle authorities, with not a penny going to the displaced villagers.

Our two-thousand-year-old villages and the collective assets of our ancestors were completely confiscated. Villagers received a mere pittance of just over ¥300 per square meter for land that had sustained our families for generations. The resettlement housing provided was not only substandard but dangerous. These buildings are designed with one staircase shared by four households on each floor, making them among the worst in Wuxi City and a far cry from the spacious homes and even villas we had enjoyed. Compared with the rest of rural Wuxi, we had been quite well-off and led prosperous lives since the liberation. Even villagers without formal jobs could live comfortably by running small shops or selling goods near the 5A-level park. Now, we are trapped in resettlement housing, landless and impoverished, with nearly 200 villagers relying on Wuxi City’s minimum subsistence allowance [6] to survive.

By 2008, our three villages had a population of around 1,700. Our review of many government documents revealed that, according to the Provincial Development and Reform Commission’s regulations, such demolitions should have been approved by the provincial government. Yet we were expelled without any due process. Faced with this injustice, more than a thousand of us took to the streets to defend our rights, filing lawsuits that climbed all the way to the Supreme People's Court of China. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that the Jiangsu Provincial High Court should hear our case. After the Provincial High Court filed the case, they did not proceed with a hearing and instead transferred it to the Wuxi Intermediate Court, where it languished, unheard and unresolved.

Following the demolition announcement in 2007, we villagers rented five or six buses to petition the provincial government in Nanjing, but the authorities forcibly dragged us back one by one. Upon our return, the main organizers were detained, and some were even sentenced. The government continues to suppress us; my own petitioning journey took me to the depths of China's shadowy detention system twice.

My first detention occurred on the night of May 17, 2011. After we were forcibly returned from petitioning the Nanjing Provincial Government, I was driven to a desolate field and surrounded. At midnight, they brought me to the police station, deprived me of sleep for 24 hours, and interrogated me about my petitioning journey and the materials I submitted. The next night, they transferred me to a black jail on a remote fish farm in Mashan Subdistrict, where I was held for 42 days. I remained resolute, drawing strength from my revolutionary family background. I faced everything calmly and firmly knowing I had done nothing wrong: after all, the State Bureau of Letters and Calls exists for citizens to petition; what right did they have to arrest me? They couldn’t break me. Each day, I was given a boxed meal, watched by four security guards who didn’t allow me to step outside the room. In that tiny motel room, there was a framed picture of a sunflower. As a woman of faith, I prayed every morning for the safety of our villagers and for justice to prevail. This belief kept my mind clear. They tried to force me to accept the resettlement housing, but I firmly refused because my house, like many others, remained stolen without legal procedures. As a result, I have been living in a state of housing insecurity for over a decade.

My second detention occurred in 2012 after we returned from petitioning in Beijing. Seventy-four of our villagers returned from Beijing on June 29. On July 5, they drove an unmarked van with plainclothes policemen, stormed into my house, and dragged me away. At that time, my neighbor had asked me to accompany her to the doctors, but they were already waiting at my door as we headed out. They threw me into the van and took me to a dark room where I was detained for 65 days. The room was so dimly lit that even the police had to borrow my glasses to see while interrogating me. They interrogated me in shifts, harassing me relentlessly for 24 hours a day, repeatedly asking about what happened in Beijing. If I didn’t talk, they wouldn’t let me sleep. The meals were meager and monotonous: a small bowl of porridge, half a piece of fried dough, and a small packet of pickled vegetables for breakfast; a basic boxed meal in a foam container for lunch, with nothing but cabbages every day.  When I stopped protesting the poor food quality, they gave me a slightly better meal with both meat and vegetables.

Seventy-four villagers went to Beijing that time, and they arrested three of us; the other two were released after one night. They believed I was the leader and wanted to make an example out of me by sentencing me to prison. They kept threatening me, saying, “let me  tell you, this ‘study session’ will never end,” trying to break me mentally. The psychological burden of being interrogated night and day would be unbearable for most people. The only reason I sustained was because of my faith. I believed that the state's actions were illegal and that one day justice would prevail. On the 65th day, they had some shady characters release me in the middle of the night, dumped me on the side of the road, and fled. They were so afraid of being caught on camera or leaving evidence, you can see how dark this society has grown. 

The toll on my family was immense. My son, returning from studies in France, was shattered by the contrast between the rule of law he had come to expect and the reality of our situation. He lost 15 kilograms (33 lbs) of weight over the 42 days of my first disappearance. Confused and distressed, he sought help from the police, who merely informed him the next day that I had been detained, dismissing his distress with a few words. When I was finally released, I went to stay at my sister’s home, and they promptly installed a camera at her door to monitor me. The next day, I stepped outside to greet a visiting friend, and as soon as they saw me on the camera, they closed the case. I had been missing for more than two months. Their methods were extremely vicious, and I knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. 

Seventeen years have passed since 2007. Our fight continues, but time is not on our side. Over 200 people from our villages have died, their grievances unaddressed and unresolved. Some elderly villagers, even on their deathbeds, asked to be carried to see their old homesteads one last time, exhorting their children to petition with me and seek the justice that had eluded them in life. Their demand is simple yet profound - to return to our original homes, to reclaim the forest land that is rightfully ours. Though I am just an ordinary villager, I carry the weight of their hopes and the fire of their indignation, and am determined to continue fighting for our home until the end. 

As I stand now, looking out over the transformed landscape of Turtle Head Isle, I see not just a picturesque park, but the ghosts of our stolen lives. The cherry blossoms may bloom and the tourists may come, but beneath the surface lies a story of injustice that refuses to be buried. Thank you for reading and amplifying our story.

我叫包海兰，我是江苏省无锡市滨湖区鼋头渚宝界村的村民。我代表着来自宝街、充山、犊山三个村的1,256名村民，我们已经被迫流离失所超过17年了。

这一切起初看起来很平常。2007年，地方政府宣布了“6699行动” [1]，宣传它是一个太湖生态修复项目。但这绿色的外衣掩盖着一个邪恶的计划，正是无锡当时的市委书记杨卫泽 [2] 主导的。他的真正意图是从我们三村居民手中夺走宝贵的土地，并很快以最残忍的方式摧毁了我们的生活。

2007年12月10日，杨卫泽调动无锡武警部队，亲自指挥，几辆大巴驶进我们的村庄进行冲击。那些反抗进入家里“评估”的村民被逮捕并押送到警察局。为了追求他们的利益，政府对我们老百姓什么手段都用起来了：所有被带到警察局的人，有拘留的，有扁担拷的，有吊起来打的。我们有大量证据，包括录像，记录下了这些暴力行为，但这些折磨只有他们亲身经历的人才能完全描述。超过60名村民被拘留，其中20多人被关在看守所，在那里他们被胁迫签署不公平的安置协议。我们村里的老年人中，许多人曾经历过日本侵略、国民党白色恐怖和解放战争，他们说从未见过政府对自己百姓如此残暴。

在这场大规模的暴力下，我们三村集体的4,974.9亩（822英亩）土地以及近2万平方米的其他建筑物被毫无法律程序地强行征收。我们的家园、田地，甚至我们代代传承的生计——都被吞并进了扩展后的鼋头渚风景区。这个5A级风景区 [3] 变成了地方政府的摇钱树，票价、停车费等收入源源不断地进入了政府的腰包。犊山村被改建成了樱花谷 [4]，入口处还设了一个¥105（约合15美元）的票亭。充山村的肥沃农田被厚厚的沥青覆盖用作停车场，年收入高达数千万。而宝街村呢？我们的命运更为可悲。为了讨好中央政府，尤其是当时的中央常委周永康 [5]，杨卫泽计划在我们这些简朴的农舍上建26栋豪华别墅，送给中央委员。虽然这个计划未能成功，我们的村庄被推平改建成了套山马路式公园和更多的停车场，以疏散巨大的客流涌入。收入全部归鼋头渚公园，一分钱也没有流向被强拆的村民。

我们两千多年的村落和祖先的集体资产被彻底没收。这片土地世世代代养活着我们的家庭，而村民们只得到了每平方米300多元的补偿。安置的住房不仅看起来不起眼，而且质量很低劣。安居房每层四间公寓，公用一个楼梯，堪称无锡市最差的居住条件，远不如我们曾经很好的房子，甚至有些家庭都有别墅。我们以前在整个无锡市农村的条件来说都是很富有的。自解放以来过得相当安稳，哪怕没有正式工作，村民也可以通过开小店或在5A级景区旁卖小商品维持生计。如今，我们被困在安置房里，成了无地可依、贫困潦倒的群体，近200名村民依靠无锡市的最低生活保障 [6] 勉强生存。

2008年，我们三个村的总人口大约在1,700人左右。根据我们查阅的许多政府文件，根据省发展改革委员会的规定，这样的拆迁应当得到省政府的批准。然而，我们却在没有任何法律程序的情况下被逼签。面对这场不公，我们超过千人团结起来捍卫自己的权益，提起诉讼，案件一路上诉至中国最高人民法院。2016年，最高法院裁定江苏省高院应当受理我们的案件。但高院立案后并未开展审理，反而将案件转交至无锡中级法院，在那里案件被搁置，不开庭、不审理，至今未得到解决。

自2007年拆迁公告发布后，我们村民曾租赁五六辆大巴去南京省政府上访，但当地政府将我们一一强行拖回。回到无锡后，主要组织者被拘留，有些人甚至被判刑。政府依旧压制着我们；我自己两次被非法拘禁，身心遭受了极大的摧残。

我的第一次关押发生在2011年5月17日晚上。在我们去南京省政府上访被强行抓回后，我被开车带到一片荒凉的田野，几个人把我团团围住。晚上12点，他们把我带到派出所，在那里24小时不让睡觉，连续审问我上访的经过和递交的材料。第二天晚上，他们将我转送到位于马山街道一个偏僻小鱼庄的黑监狱，在那里我被关押了42天。我心情始终自信坚定，汲取了来自我革命家庭背景的力量，很坦然地面对一切。我明白自己并没有做错事：国家信访局设立是为了让公民去信访，凭什么非法拘捕我？他们无法打破我的意志。每天我只能吃盒饭，四个保安轮流看守，不让我走出房间一步。在那狭小的旅馆房间里，墙上正好挂着一幅向日葵的照片。我是一个有信仰的人，每天早晨起来祷告，保佑我们三村村民平安，保佑我们能够有公平正义的一天。我的信念让我保持了清晰的头脑。他们想强迫我接受安房，我坚决不同意，因为我的房子和很多其他村民的房子是被非法征收的。至今十多年过去了，我仍然处于漂泊流浪的状态。

第二次拘留发生在2012年，我们村里有74人一起去了北京上访，6月29日返回无锡。7月5日，有一辆没有标识的面包车和便衣警察冲进我家，强行将我带走。当时，我邻居要我陪她去看医生，我一开门就被等在门口的便衣拽走了。他们把我塞进面包车里，拉到一个黑房间里，关押了65天。屋内昏暗无光，连警察审问我时都得问我借眼镜，才能看清他要写的材料。他们24小时轮番审问我，反复让我讲在北京的过程。如果我不说话，他们就骚扰我、阻止我睡觉。食物又差又单一：早餐是一小碗稀饭，一小块油条和一小包咸菜；午餐则是盒饭，每天只有白菜吃。我一直抗议，直到我过了几天不吵了，他们才稍微给了我一些有荤有素的盒饭。

我们全村有74个老百姓去北京，有3人被关押，其中两人一夜后被放出，警察认为我们村出去那么多人是我领队的，想通过我来杀鸡儆猴。他们不断恐吓我：“我告诉你，这个‘学习班’是只有开始没有结束的。”连日连夜的折磨几乎让人无法承受。我能坚持下来只因为我的信仰。我坚信政府的行为是不合法的，总有一天正义会降临。65天后，他们让一些社会上不三不四的人把我硬拽出去，半夜把我往马路边上一扔就迅速逃走，生怕留下证据。所以说这个社会已经黑暗得没办法了。

我的家庭也受到了巨大的折磨。我的儿子从法国留学回来，看到我们的遭遇，彻底懵掉了。第一次非法关押我42天，他瘦了15公斤（33英镑）。我失踪后他满心困惑和痛苦，报警寻求帮助，警方却只在第二天轻描淡写地告诉他我被拘留了。直到我被释放后，去姐姐家暂住，政府立刻在她家门口装了监控摄像头。第二天，当我出去迎接一位来访的朋友时，摄像头监控中看到我后，他们就当失踪人找到了，立即关闭了案件。我当时已经失踪了两个月以上。这些的手段极其卑劣，我知道他们的行为完全是违法的。

自2007年以来已经17年过去了，我们的斗争依然在继续，但时间对我们不利。我们三个村庄的200多位村民已经含冤去世，他们的冤屈未曾得到回应和解决。一些年迈的村民临终前还特地请求子女开车带他们回到老宅看看。他们叮嘱子女一定要见我一面，问问我们的问题是否能得到解决。他们希望后代不要放弃，要继续争取他们有生之年未能获得的公正。他们的诉求简单却深刻——还我家园，回到那片属于我们的山林地。虽然我只是一个普通的村民，但我肩负着他们的期望，承载着他们热忱的火焰，决心继续为我们的家园而奋斗，直到最后一刻。

如今，我站在这里，俯瞰着已经改变了模样的鼋头渚，我看到的并不是一个风景优美的公园，而是我们被剥夺的生活的阴影。樱花年年盛开，游客络绎不绝，但在这表面之下，埋藏着一个拒绝被掩埋的不公正故事。感谢您阅读并传播我们的故事。
