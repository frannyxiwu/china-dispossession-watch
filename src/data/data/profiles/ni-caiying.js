const englishText = `I am Ni Caiying, a villager from No.78 Ji Alley, Qing'er Village, Yangming Town, Liangxi District, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. My home was a privately built property — a three-story building and a single-story house totaling around 150 square meters (1,615 square feet). With my daughter away studying at university in Beijing, I lived alone in the house. I was 48 then, still years away from retirement.

On June 28, 2006, they deliberately cut off electricity and water to my house without warning for over ten days. The summer heat was oppressive, and surviving without water was impossible. I was forced to fetch water myself, stretching each bucket to last for several days. On the evening of July 9, after dinner, I grabbed a bucket and headed out to ask my neighbors in the public housing complex for some water. As I walked out, a massive dump truck the size of a cargo container came barreling toward me. When the driver spotted me, he drove the truck right up to my house. Though frightened, I tried to stay composed. Fearing he might hit me and later claim "you weren't walking carefully," I stood perfectly still, clutching my bucket. The truck menacingly moved back and forth for a minute or two, clearly trying to intimidate me. Then the driver spotted a high-voltage electric pole and suddenly slammed into it in reverse. In a split second, the pole was knocked down and collapsed, the power lines snapped and fell to the ground. When the power lines fell, I was terrified, sensing immense danger and a strong gut feeling that death by electrocution was imminent. Anyone with electrical knowledge understands the danger: when high-voltage lines hit the ground, they create a 100,000-volt differential and a lethal 20-meter radius. If you're caught in it, staying still might save you, but a single movement means instant death—your body reduced to charcoal. I was standing near the outer edge of this deadly circle. In that split second, I knew I had to run, but after taking just one step, I was somehow flung far beyond the danger zone—much farther than I could have run on my own. It was some kind of divine intervention that saved me from electrocution.

In an instant, the entire area lost power. Nearby entertainment venues — tea houses, KTVs, and shops — emptied as their employees came over to discover the scene of my accident. Someone called emergency services, and I was rushed to the hospital, leaving my house vacant. When I arrived at the hospital, I couldn't move a muscle. I had fractured my ankle, my entire leg had swollen to elephant proportions from toes to thigh. My ankle, broken for nearly two decades now, still flares up regularly, making walking painful and difficult. To put it nicely, I was in a traffic accident; to put it bluntly, they saw a vulnerable woman living alone and deliberately targeted me for my property. They coveted my house and should have negotiated with me properly. Instead, without a single discussion or agreement, they used these vile tactics to put me in the hospital so they could dispossess me.

On August 22, they took advantage of the night to demolish my three-story house. Neighbors who witnessed the scene described it like an earthquake or a smoke bomb explosion — the three-story building collapsed diagonally. They called to notify me, and I rushed back from the hospital. At that moment, I felt as if the sky itself had collapsed. All my possessions lay buried in the rubble, I had nothing left. My house was filled with treasured personal items: I loved painting since childhood, and was an award-winning painter with both my own artwork and collected pieces, all now destroyed. Many other items disappeared as well. Neighbors reported seeing the demolition crew carrying away my large appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators. Everything in my cabinets was entombed when the building fell. A few days later, my single-story house was also demolished. It was 6.5 meters wide and 11 meters long, where I had been raising goldfish. These goldfish were very precious, not only were they valuable ornamental breeds that provided supplemental income, but I had also developed deep emotional bonds with them. The number of fish in the pond was countless. Each November, people would travel from as far as Xinjiang and Hong Kong to purchase them. I had diverse varieties: pearl fish, red-and-white tiger-headed fish, bubble fish, and more—the round pearl fish being particularly striking. Due to the threat of demolition, I had to stop raising them. On March 20, 2007, the demolition team returned with excavators and razed the ruins of my home. I still have photographic evidence of the act. After the forced demolition, my house's location became the Wuxi World Trade Center, which remains an unfinished building to this day. When I went to them for a resolution, they tried to renege by saying it was already an abandoned project. I replied, "What you did with my house after seizing it is your business, not mine."

After my house was demolished, I became homeless and had no choice but to rent. After the forced demolition, I was constantly distracted and couldn't focus at work. In September 2006, a case was finally filed regarding the deliberate destruction of my property. By December, my fracture had healed enough that I decided to seek justice through petitioning. The Beijing Public Security Bureau issued me a letter essentially directing the local authorities to resolve my illegal situation. I also approached the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Department, who sent a referral letter asking Wuxi City to address my case. After my Beijing visit, Nanchang District Public Security Bureau forcibly returned me in an unlicensed vehicle and confined me to a hotel for a ten-day "study session" [1]. During the detention, they said to me, "What's the use of going to Beijing? The mountains are high and the emperor is far away [2]." I retorted, "Are you claiming to be a local emperor?" Are you claiming to be a local emperor?" I was imprisoned with two guards — one man, one woman — stationed outside my door. They occasionally brought meager boxed meals, but generally left me to starve and were indifferent to my survival. Periodically, groups would arrive to photos, fabricating stories that they had tried reasoning with me unsuccessfully. These staged images were passed to superiors as evidence of their efforts. When they came, I would hide completely under my blanket, refusing to participate in their charade. I protested, "You have no right to hold me here. This is restriction of personal freedom and illegal imprisonment." They told the visitors, "Don't bother with this one." I was certainly very angry at that time. They had nailed the windows shut to prevent me from jumping out, and removed all furnishings, including the television, fearing I might damage property or harm myself. After ten days, I demanded a "graduation certificate" from their "study session." They refused, offering no explanation. My only proof of this illegal detention was an administrative compensation document from the branch bureau.

On May 9, 2007, I returned from petitioning in Beijing. That day was Wuxi City's official petition reception day, publicly announced in the Wuxi Daily newspaper, with many attendees. Upon arrival, I sought out  Deputy Secretary Zhu Jianxin of Yangming Town. A line had formed, with me second in queue. Zhu, already frustrated by the person ahead of me, directed his anger toward me. As I took my seat, he demanded, "Why are you here?" I explained I was petitioning, to which he snapped, "Don't speak to me!" I responded, "You're sitting in this position—if not you, who should I approach?" This exchange escalated his anger. He rose, pointed his hand at me accusingly, and barked, "Don't come to me — go to the World Trade Center." Following this confrontation, he became violent. As a former military man with a significant physical advantage, he knocked me to the ground with a single punch. My head struck a nearby stool, raising a large bump. As I fell, my hands instinctively braced against the impact, resulting in three fractures including my wrist, while my right tibia also snapped. Lying helpless on the floor, he assumed I was feigning injury and stomped on my knee one more time. A male petitioner witnessing this assault confronted Zhu: "You're both a government official and a man — why are you attacking a woman?" This sparked a brawl between them. The man, more Zhu's physical equal, landed a punch that sent Zhu stumbling backward several meters into a stool. Zhu visited our local Luozhuang Hospital with only minor bleeding and a wound — no fractures, which would have meant criminal charges. The male petitioner received ten days' detention, he intended to sue but Zhu ultimately bribed him with money to drop any potential lawsuit.

Bystanders called emergency services, and I was rushed to the hospital in severe condition. My fracture required surgical insertion of a 60-centimeter artificial tibia. Concerned about nerve damage from traditional bone-cutting techniques, the medical team drilled eight holes in my bone. Following the implant, bone damage triggered septicemia, and weakened immunity led to systemic lupus erythematosus. This devastating illness left me completely bedridden for seven years — immobile in a vegetative state. During that time, I battled 43 different diseases, including nephritis, septicemia, and lupus. Pericardial effusion flooded my chest and abdominal cavities with fluid, my abdomen grotesquely distended like a balloon, barely recognizable as human. After exhausting all medical options in Wuxi, I sought treatment in Suzhou, Nanjing, and Zhejiang. Finally, at Nanjing Military Hospital, doctors successfully treated my condition. After draining the abdominal fluid, I lost 30 kilograms, couldn't sit up, and remained permanently disabled. I financed my medical care entirely through loans. When I approached Yangming Town officials for financial assistance, they responded, "If you need money for treatment, just sign the demolition agreement." How could I possibly sign under such circumstances? For years, I borrowed money for life-saving medical treatments, sinking deeper into crushing debt.

Each day of that period stretched into an eternity. Unable to move my head, I could only stare at the ceiling of the hospital room. I couldn’t hold back tears the feelings were indescribable. My body ravaged by illness, I fought death daily alone as my only daughter was still in Beijing. In those darkest moments, I made a solemn vow: once I could sit up, I would get to Beijing even if I had to crawl. By 2014, though still desperately weak, through sheer determination and willpower, I gradually learned to sit and eventually traveled to Beijing in a wheelchair. Exhausting every ounce of strength, I finally collapsed at Jiujing Zhuang — the gathering place for disabled petitioners, while the able-bodied went to Majialou. The overcrowded conditions and my raging fever caused me to collapse. I was hospitalized at Beijing's Nanyang Hospital for six months. During October's National Day military parade, authorities cleared all petitioners, forcibly returning me home. As soon as my strength minimally returned, I resumed petitioning. Nineteen years have now passed. I remain homeless, my case classified as a prominent administrative law violation.

Living with multiple conditions including lupus, I depend on steroids and numerous medications year-round. Merely maintaining my current state is a remarkable feat. The disease can become life-threatening without warning when it flares. Last year, it suddenly relapsed — high fever, violent vomiting, and incapacitating dizziness sent me to emergency care. Fortunately, treatment succeeded, and I was transferred to a ward. Had the intervention failed, I would have died. Before this demolition nightmare, I enjoyed perfect health — practicing Tai Chi every morning and running around the nearby Taihu Square after dinner. Had I been physically compromised on the day of the truck incident, I surely wouldn't have escaped electrocution. Beyond repeatedly inflicting disabling violence upon me, their transgressions were numerous. They should have negotiated resettlement and compensation before any demolition — instead, they treated me as less than human. My property should have been professionally assessed, registered, listed, and legally preserved. Rather than following proper procedures, they conducted a forced demolition without legal expropriation documents, which was plain robbery. Through pursuing administrative review, I've established that my land was legally protected rural collective property. They simply targeted me because I was a woman living alone. Over these nineteen years, I've become a disabled person consumed by illness, stripped of home and health, yet I continue fighting for my legitimate rights, clinging to hope that justice will eventually prevail.

我是江苏省无锡市梁溪区扬名镇清二村纪巷78号的村民倪彩英。我的房子是自己造的私房，有一栋三层的楼房、一栋平房，总共150平米左右。我女儿在北京上大学，家里只有我一个人住，我当时48岁还没退休。

2006年6月28号，他们在没有提前通知的情况下故意给我的房子停电停水，停了十多天。夏天天气很热，没有水的话完全没法生存，逼着我自己出去挑水，挑一桶回去要吃几天。7月9日晚饭后我手里提着一个桶，打算出门问前面公房的邻居讨要一些水。迎面开来了一辆集装箱一样又高又大的自卸卡车，司机看到我以后，就把车开到我的家门前。当时我虽然害怕，但还是比较镇静，也怕他撞我，心里想不要万一出了车祸被说“是你走路不小心”，所以我手里拎着桶、站在原地不动。自卸车一会往前、一会往后开了一两分钟，倒来倒去地吓唬我。然后他看到了一根高压电线杆，突然间就倒车撞了上去。电线杆被撞断倒塌，电线也断了、眼看着就掉在地上。电线掉下来的一瞬间瞬间我心里很害怕，感觉到了强烈的危险和危机感，感觉会触电死了。懂电的人都知道，高压电线碰落在地面产生一个十万伏的电压差，碰到地会产生一个大约20米的同心圆。如果碰到人的话人不动还可以、如果动一动马上就会死，变成焦炭一样。当时我站的位置在同心圆靠外的地方，电光火石之间我脑子里想着肯定要跑，但我迈了一脚后立刻飞出去了，飞得很远跌出了同心圆，如果光靠跑肯定是没有那么远。也是老天帮忙，让我免于被电死的命运。

一瞬间整个区域都停电了，附近有好多的娱乐场所，比如茶室、KTV，以及其他的店，里面的人就找过来，看到我出了事故。他们帮我打了110，我被送到医院里医治，家里就没人住了。到医院的时候我整个人都不能动，虽然我骨折的是脚踝，但是整条腿就像大象腿一样，从脚趾一直肿到大腿。我的脚踝从断到现在已经快二十年了，还是老是要发病，不好走路。这次经历说得好听一点就是出了车祸，说得难听一点就是他们看我孤家寡人一个，要谋财害命。他们看中我的房子，应该来跟我商量。没有商量、没有协议，用这种下三滥的手段故意把我弄到医院里，然后在深夜抢我的房子。

8月22号，他们趁着夜色把我的楼房扒了。目睹现场的邻居形容说看到像地震一样、又像是烟雾弹爆炸了，三层的楼房就这么斜着倒下去了。他们电话通知我从医院赶回家，当时我的心情感觉天塌了。财产都埋在废墟里了，我一无所有了。我的房子里有很多收藏的私人物品：我非常喜欢画画，曾经画画得过奖。家里自己的画也有、收藏的画也有，全都被毁了。我还有其他很多物品消失了，听邻居说来拆迁的人把大件的空调、冰箱等从我家移走了。放在橱柜里的物品在楼房倒塌的时候都被掩埋了。过了几天后，我的平房也被拆了。平房是6.5米宽、11米长，我本来在里面养金鱼。这些金鱼是很珍贵的，不仅因为它们是品种很好的观赏鱼、是我赚钱补贴家用的第三产业，我跟它们的感情也是很深厚的。池子里养鱼的数量是数不清的、太多了，每到十一月的时候，有好多人到我家来买鱼，甚至还有从新疆、香港远道而来到我家拿鱼的。鱼的种类繁多，比如珍珠鱼、红白两色的虎头鱼、水泡鱼等等，最好看的就是圆圆的珍珠鱼。因为拆迁的威胁我也只好不养了。2007年3月20号，拆迁团队又开着挖掘机来了，把我房子的废墟都铲平了，我还保留着照片证据。强拆之后，我房子的位置变成了世贸大厦，世贸大厦现在还是烂尾楼。我去找他们解决的时候，他们试图说这已经是烂尾楼了来赖账，我说“你们把我的房子抢去了派什么用场，是你们的事，不关我的事”。

房子被拆之后我无家可归了，没办法只能租房。房子被强拆了以后，我整天魂不守舍，连连上班都没心思了。2006年9月，我房子的故意破坏财务案立案了。到12月的时候，我骨折的脚恢复了一点，想着要解决问题，就去上访。北京公安部给我出具了一份信笺，核心旨意是要求回到地方上为我解决这个违规的事。我也去了江苏省公安厅，他们也回了一封介绍信叫无锡市解决我的问题。我去北京之后，南长区公安局用黑车把我押回来，把我关在宾馆里给我办了为期十天的“学习班”。学习班期间，他们对我说，“你去北京，山高皇帝远，有啥用啊？”我回答说，“难道你是土皇帝吗？”我被关在里面，有两个人在门口看我，一男一女，偶尔会给我送点盒饭，但总体来说是忍饥挨饿、没人管我的死活。过一段时间就来一批人拍个照，为了编造谎言说做我思想工作做不通、拿着摆拍的照片给上级交差。他们来，我就把被子盖在脸上，整个人都藏在里面，不配合他们造假。我说，“你没有理由把我关在这里，这叫限制人身自由、叫事实羁押。”他们对来的人说：“这个人不要跟她烦。”那个时候我肯定是很气愤的，他们把窗户都钉得死死的防止我跳楼，房间里连电视机都没有，以防我砸东西或者自残。十天后我向他们索要“学习班”的“结业证书”，他们说没有证书，也不给我一个说法，我只有一张分局的行政赔偿书作为坐了黑监狱的凭证。

2007年5月9号，我从北京上访回来，那天是整个无锡市指定的信访接待日，无锡日报上登出了具体信息，现场很多人参加。我去到现场以后找扬名街道副书记朱建新，我前面排了一队人在反映他们的事，轮到我是第二个。朱建新在前面的人那里受了挫折、就针对我出气。我刚刚面对他坐下，他说“你到这里来干嘛”，我说我来上访，他说“你别跟我说！”我说“你坐在那张位置，我不找你找谁？”然后他就站起来发火，用手指着我，说“你不要来找我，你去找世贸。”这一番争执之后他就动起手来。他是当过兵的，又是男人，把我一拳打倒在地，我的头磕在旁边的凳子上起了一个大包。我跌倒的时候手下意识地一撑，造成了包括手腕在内的三处骨折，右腿的胫骨也摔断了。我整个人倒地了，他还以为我是装死，还再来踩我一脚，踩到我的膝盖上。现场有一个男性访民，看到我挨打，对朱建新说：“你又是一个干部、又是一个男人，为什么要去打女人？”然后朱建新跟那个男的又厮打起来，他相比我来说身高和力量上和朱建新比较抗衡。他一拳打出去让朱建新退了两三米跌倒在凳脚上，于是他就到我们扬名的小医院芦庄医院去看，他就流了一点血，破了个伤口，没有骨折伤。如果有骨折的话那肯定要判刑，结果就是那个男的被拘留了十天以后，朱建新把他买通了。那个男的本来他要告他，结果私下给了他钱，就没告上法院。

围观的人报了110和120把我送去医院，我的情况就严重了。我的骨折需要手术来接胫骨，给我放了一条六十公分的人造胫。医疗团队担心传统的划骨手术对神经损伤比较严重，就采用了钻骨的手法，钻了八个洞。人造胫放进去以后，骨质受损引起了败血症，免疫低下诱发了红斑狼疮。这个病就大了，我整个人瘫在床上瘫了整整七年，像植物人一样一动都动不了。七年里我总共生过43种病，例如肾炎、败血症和系统性红斑狼疮等，心包积液导致胸腔腹腔全都积满了液，我的肚皮像热气球一样鼓胀得很大，整个人都不像人了。无锡市的医生都看过了、没法帮助我，我只能辗转去苏州、南京、浙江求医。后来在南京部队医院终于把病看好了，一肚子的积水去掉整个人瘦了60斤，坐都坐不起来，变成了终身残疾。我看病的钱都是借的，我也问过扬名街道的书记和主任要过钱，他们说“你看病需要钱，你把拆迁协议的字签掉就给你钱”。这种情况下我能签吗？我多年来只能借钱救命，导致债台高筑。

我当时是度日如年，头动不了只能朝着病房的天花板，流的眼泪止不住，心里的味道是真的无法形容。我身体被病痛侵袭、不断和死神作斗争，我唯一的女儿还在北京，每天都被妻离子散的荒凉无助感折磨。我那个时候就发了一个誓言，等我可以坐起来，我肯定爬都要爬到北京去。到了2014年，我虽然身体还是很差、一点力气都没有，但是全凭自己的毅力和决心慢慢地学着坐起来，坐着轮椅去北京。我拼尽全力，最后倒在了久敬庄。我们所有的访民，残疾的都去久敬庄，身体健康的都去马家楼。久敬庄里面人实在太拥挤，我又发着高烧，就这样倒下去，被送去北京的南阳医院住了半年。半年后北京十一国庆节阅兵，就把访民全部清场，我就被清回家了。等我身体又恢复一点，我还是坚持上访，就这样一直到现在有十九年了，我还是无家可归，我的情况已经属于行政违法积案突出问题。

我的身体有这么多病和红斑狼疮，常年吃激素药等各种药物，能维持已经不错了，它要发起来的时候是不要命的，说哪一天发都不知道。去年我的病突然复发，症状是发高烧、呕吐、头晕得天旋地转，我被送到医院里抢救。最后结果还比较顺利，就把我送到病房里去，如果抢救不过来就死了。我在受到拆迁的折磨前是什么病都没有的，每天早上起来锻炼、打太极拳，吃过晚饭后在家附近的太湖广场跑一圈。你想如果我身体不好，他们大卡车来撞电线杆恐吓我的那天我肯定是跑不出去的。除了多次将我折磨致残，他们的违法行径很多，首先他们要拆迁应该先和我协商安置和补偿，但他们对我从来不理不睬，不把我当人看。然后我的财产起码应该评估、登记挂牌、公证保全。最后他们并不是正常手续拆迁而是强拆，又没有征收的合法文件，说得难听一点就是抢劫。我去行政复议过，我的地块是属于农村的集体土地，都是有法律依据的。他们就是欺负我一个女的，家里只有我一个人。十九年来，我变成了一个病痛缠身的残疾人，失去了家园和健康，但我仍然坚持为自己的正当权益发声，希望有朝一日能够得到公正的对待。
