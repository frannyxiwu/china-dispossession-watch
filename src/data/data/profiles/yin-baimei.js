const englishText = `My name is Yin Baimei, I’m from Yangjian Town in Xishan District, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. In 2009, the Yangjian township government forcibly demolished our house, which wasn't even within the demolition zone. Sixteen years have passed, and the issue remains unresolved. Our home sheltered four generations under one roof: my husband's grandmother, myself, my husband, our then teenage daughter, and my husband's parents. We existed as two separate households—my husband's parents and grandmother constituted one household, while my husband, daughter, and I formed another—yet the government, with callous indifference to the amount of family members living there, insisted on treating us as a single household for compensation purposes.

Our home was substantial and well-built: it consisted of a three-story building stood in front, three rooms in the back that were also multi-storied though without completed roofing (the roofed sections lacked full second and third floors), and another row of rooms centered between them—effectively three parallel structures. Our house shared a connecting wall with my husband's brother's home. When demolition crews tore down his brother's house, they callously stripped away several rows of tiles from our roof. Later, when it rained, we returned from work to discover water cascading through our ceilings. Not understanding the cause, we initially attributed it to leaking floor slabs. Soon our television, furniture, and appliances all succumbed to water damage. When we climbed onto the roof to inspect, we discovered they had knocked off three rows of our roof tiles. They committed this reckless destruction because they had already decided they would eventually demolish our house too.

After my husband's brother's house was demolished, they could enter our house through the breach, making multiple intimidating intrusions. They took everything they could carry, including cooking utensils from our stove and bowls. Once, while we were away, they demolished our courtyard wall. On several other occasions, they destroyed our doors and windows. We immediately reported the incidents to police, but it proved futile — officers either refused to come or, when they did arrive, declined to file any official report. One Sunday, my husband and I were away at work, our daughter was alone at home for school break. Men from the demolition company smashed through five layers of doors in our property and nearly reached my daughter's bedroom. My daughter, barely sixteen or seventeen, was startled awake by the violent commotion. Though terrified, she bravely defended our home, physically struggling with the intruders for the crowbar they wielded to pry open our doors. A neighbor from the village telephoned us, allowing us to rush back before the worst could happen. 

Next, they deliberately destroyed all roads surrounding our property. My husband had to drive a medium-sized tractor pulling a farm vehicle with an electric vespa loaded inside — an absurd transportation chain just for our family to enter and exit our own property. They were constructing the Xizhang Highway nearby at the time, but our home was not within the designated demolition zone — the local government had arbitrarily expanded their reach. Utility cutoffs became a routine weapon against us. They severed all our power lines, forcing us to use candles for light at nights. When they cut our water, we resorted to drawing from our own well. Thankfully, my daughter was boarding at school and returning only for weekends, though life remained incredibly difficult for the elderly members of our household. Reporting to the police was useless, in those days, we felt that neither heaven nor earth would respond to our pleas—I still don’t know how we managed to survive.

On July 5, 2008, through deception, local officials coerced my husband into signing a document with blank terms [1]. They had promised to compensate us with four apartments for our two households. When we requested to see the agreement, they claimed they needed to stamp it first, but they never gave it to us. After getting our signature, they brazenly reneged, attempting to consolidate us into a single household and withhold half of our rightful compensation. One sympathetic demolition company worker, seeing our predicament, advised me not to vacate until they properly resolved our resettlement. So we heeded this counsel and remained. After countless fruitless attempts seeking resolution from township and village authorities, I made my first visit to the Xishan District People's Government Petition Office [2] on January 8, 2009. There, through tears, I pleaded our case. Officials reassured me, "If the issue isn't resolved, they won't demolish your house." This promise proved cruelly false—the very next day, January 9, they forcibly reduced our home to rubble.

I wasn't home when the demolition crews arrived that fateful January morning. Neighbors in our village called to alert us our house was being torn down. We rushed back, but arrived to find the roof and ceiling completely stripped away, only the floor slabs still intact. I desperately tried to halt the destruction, explaining our situation. I emphasized that we had no extraordinary demands — we simply wanted the two-household compensation they had promised when securing my husband's signature. One demolition worker, moved by my distress, suggested: "Lie down on the top floor slab and see if they dare continue the demolition."

I followed his advice, laying myself across the exposed floor slab, but this proved futile and the demolition proceeded relentlessly. I called the police, but their arrival was meaningless — they refused to document the incident and departed after cursory visits. One officer once told me, "You should simply leave. If you stay, soon we won't be able to access this area either. If they beat you to death, we wouldn't even know about it." Because the roads were damaged, police couldn't easily reach our home. One time we called the police when it was raining, a police vehicle approached but retreated, officers only returning after donning protective footwear. The demolition crews — not village officials but hired demolition company workers — pillaged anything of value from our home, including pots and pans from the stove. I vividly recall I had a winter coat where I had hidden ¥3,000 ($414) in cash — they found and stole that too. After the house was demolished, I stayed with another villager at the village committee building, sleeping in the public hall. Later, the village leadership sent someone to deceive me, promising, "They will certainly compensate you for your medium-sized tractor. Come with me to the demolition office to resolve this." He took me there, but the meeting was fruitless. When I returned from the demolition office, the villager who had accompanied me had been expelled from the building where we camped, they had locked the door in our face.

I was deeply indignant and persistently sought out village committee members and township officials, demanding justice. Eventually, with no other options, we reluctantly accepted a single resettlement apartment where our family of three took shelter. My husband’s parents, working as factory security guards, lived in their workplace's gatehouse. In my continuing efforts to reclaim our property, I journeyed to Beijing to petition higher authorities. Shortly after, the resettlement apartment we had just renovated was deliberately set on fire as retaliation. During renovations, my husband and I had been living in the underground parking garage, moving upstairs only as the New Year approached. One December night in 2010, my husband and I were jolted awake by alarming crackling sounds and discovered our bathroom engulfed in flames. Neighbors from the floor below alerted authorities while others on our floor rushed to help extinguish the fire. The bathroom was completely destroyed—shower stall, basin, all ruined—and our living room left blackened with smoke damage. We lived on the top floor of a six-story building, with a roof skylight that allowed easy access to anyone, and the bathroom had a window through which incendiary materials could be thrown. Following the incident, I went to numerous departments, and the police captain and lieutenant both visited our home. We checked the roof and found footprints, which they photographed as evidence. I pressed them to determine the fire’s cause. If it was electrical, our newly installed appliances would warrant manufacturer liability. Later, a new police captain confirmed the fire wasn't caused by electrical failure but manmade issues. I asked them to investigate, but nothing came of it. Though I lack definitive proof, I suspect this was arson intended to intimidate and punish me for my petitioning activities.

For years, my husband and I persisted in petitioning to reclaim our rightful property, appealing to People's Congress representatives. In January 2021, we traveled to Beijing and arrived outside the Great Hall of the People [3]. I held my written petition and asked my husband to take a photo of me. Several fellow petitioners noticed us, approached, and joined us for a group photograph—six of us standing together in solidarity. Upon returning home, we were placed under residential surveillance [4] on January 22. Late on January 28, officers from the Wuxi Public Security Bureau's Liangxi Branch, Yinglongqiao Police Station, forcibly removed my husband from our home without presenting any legal documentation and confiscated his phone. They brought a locksmith and knocked perfunctorily before picking our lock. I was standing right there, watching dozens of uniformed men storm in and drag my husband away. When I demanded to see their warrant, challenging them—"Are you conducting an illegal home search?"—they produced nothing. One officer merely waved a phone screen in my face, showing me nothing discernible. I physically struggled with them, attempting to prevent them from taking my husband, even blocking their vehicle downstairs. Eventually, I followed them all the way to Yinglongqiao Police Station, maintaining a vigil until dawn. My daughter, too, was cuffed at our doorstep and taken to the police station. Because her infant son needed breastfeeding, my sister-in-law and son-in-law drove to Yinglongqiao Police Station to demand her release. The officers denied detaining her, claiming personnel from Yangjian Police Station had taken her. When my sister-in-law, carrying my grandson, went to the Yangjian station, they finally released my daughter. During this period, which was winter, my daughter wasn't allowed to use the bathroom when needed and was forced to urinate in her pants. They also denied her a change of clothes. Fearing they would target me and my grandson next, I took him and fled, beginning a period of homelessness. During this difficult time, my grandson suffered terribly. We couldn't maintain normal living conditions, struggled to obtain essential items like diapers, and were forced to rely on the charity of others, moving constantly to avoid detection.

They interrogated my husband about photographs taken at the Great Hall of the People, claiming they had been posted online abroad — something we knew nothing about. he was released in the early morning of January 30 with a residential surveillance order. Until March 30, he remained under constant watch, forbidden to leave our home. This period coincided with pandemic control measures; only after the implementation of "zero-COVID" policies [5] did they permit him to resume work. My husband had originally led a team of workers at a construction site. Before his detention, my husband had supervised a team of construction workers. His forced absence created substantial financial losses. The rebar connection work he oversaw went unmanaged, requiring expensive rework of client projects. His employer had to compensate affected clients, with these costs ultimately transferred to us.

On May 28, 2021, when my husband went to harvest wheat from our contracted field, the village party secretary — who was a known scoundrel and bully — led four village officials to surround him. They knocked him to the ground and physically prevented him from harvesting. My husband suffered facial injuries on both sides, his arms were severely swollen from the beating, and his mobile phone was smashed. Being choked nearly to suffocation, my desperate husband bit one of the officials in self-defense. They immediately called the police, who took my husband to the station, who took my husband to the station and charged him with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" [6]. He received a 200-yuan fine and an eight-day detention order, though the detention was ultimately not executed. But they were the ones who had initiated the violence — my husband was merely harvesting wheat on land he had legitimately contracted. The following day, May 29, after his release from the police station, my husband returned to continue harvesting. Village officials again interfered, this time dumping all his harvested wheat onto the ground to rot, refusing to let him take it home. I wrote dozens of emergency appeals to various government departments, pleading for protection of our grain. Late on June 10, the Yangjian Town deputy secretary and our village committee secretary summoned my husband to a meeting, saying they wanted to negotiate harvesting arrangements. My husband insisted on a proper resolution to the issue, given the forcible obstruction of his previous harvesting attempts. That same night, they harvested our wheat themselves without our consent.

Our contracted land was leased from Meicheng Company, which had sent us a legal letter saying they would reclaim our fields if we failed to pay rent by June 21. On June 20, without money to pay rent and desperate to keep our only means of income, I journeyed to my brother's home in Changshu City to borrow money. Yangjian Police officers followed us to Changshu and surrounded my brother's house overnight. At daybreak on June 21, they stormed in and took me from my brother's home. My niece demanded to see their search warrant. They claimed to have one but never produced it despite hours of delay. They ransacked my brother's home, turning belongings upside down to search for my phone. Unable to find it, they also detained my brother at Changshu's Zhangqiao Police Station, pressuring me to surrender my phone in exchange for my brother's release. I agreed to accompany them if they presented legal paperwork for my arrest, but they simply dragged me away without documentation. That afternoon, they took me to Yinglongqiao Police Station, where hired thugs kept watch over me until around 10:30 PM, when they transferred me to Yangjian Police Station and released me. When I questioned why I had been detained, they refused to answerI refused to leave the station without proper documentation, and only then did they produce a residential surveillance order identical to my husband's. In my view, residential surveillance and conducting a warrantless search of my brother's home are entirely separate legal matters requiring different justifications.

On June 24, my husband and I defied their surveillance to plant rice in our contracted fields — our previous batch of wheat had either rotted where it stood or been forcibly harvested, and we needed to sow new crops to sustain our livelihoods. But village committee members again materialized to block us. We called the police, who instructed that no action should be taken until the underlying dispute was resolved. But the village committee completely disregarded the police. From that day to the present, the farmland that sustained us remains stolen. They imported large-scale farmers from outside the city to usurp our land, who continue to cultivate our fields to this day. On June 27, while my husband and I were confined to our home by hired thugs, my daughter used her Sunday off work to check whether our planted rice had sprouted. She witnessed a medium-sized tractor turning over our entire field. Eventually, we received compensation for the wheat they had commandeered, but our seized farmland has never been returned. My original home site has been transformed into parkland near the Xizhang Highway and planted with some ornamental trees. If I were to visit the site, I could still pinpoint exactly where my house once stood.

We have petitioned in Beijing for many years and been forcibly returned and detained in black jails [7] countless times. In 2020, I was confined in the Fangqian Petition Center for ten days. I was suffering excruciating headaches, laid bedridden and completely incapacitated. The former director of the Comprehensive Management Office brought doctors from Yangjian Hospital and Xishan Hospital to check my blood pressure but deliberately withheld their diagnosis. Later, village committee members dispatched a van, dumped me at my doorstep, took a photograph of me, and abandoned me with complete indifference to my survival. Thankfully, my neighbors called my husband who was working. When he returned, I asked him to take me to the police station, declaring: "Even if I die, I want to die at the police station." Eventually, police officers sent me to Yangjian Hospital, where I learned my blood pressure had dangerously exceeded 200. The abuse I suffered during these many detentions has condemned me to lifelong medication dependence.

On June 22, 2013, another rights defender from Wuxi, Ding Hongfen, along with her father and five others, was forcibly returned from Beijing and detained at the East Suburb Business Hotel in Anzheng, Xishan District. She telephoned us pleading for assistance. We went to the location but merely observed from the landscaped area across from the hotel, taking no direct action. Later, I watched as Ding Hongfen was taken away by local officials, and we all dispersed to our homes. By evening on June 26, those who had shown up in solidarity with Ding Hongfen were successively detained. I was seized by a gang from Yangjian Police Station at my residential complex entrance, forced into a vehicle, and imprisoned at the Dongjian Heping Hotel in Binhu District for an entire week. During this detention, I endured vicious slaps that caused permanent, irreversible damage to my hearing. They employed this torture to extract a confession about who had supposedly "orchestrated" our presence on June 22, desperately seeking to criminalize our peaceful solidarity. Having committed no crime and witnessed nothing illegal, I couldn't fabricate the testimony they demanded. When I couldn't corroborate their conspiracies, they slapped me continuously and relentlessly. I was very scared and wept uncontrollably from the pain, but they forbade me from crying — if I cried, they struck me harder.

On July 2, they transferred twelve of us who had gathered for Ding Hongfen to Wuxi Detention Center for a month of criminal detention. My husband was also imprisoned. I was subjected to many grueling interrogations there. On July 31, the Yangjian Police Station deputy director arrived with an associate, pressuring me to sign an agreement with the words: "Yin Baimei, have you reflected thoroughly? If so, sign this agreement, and I'll take you home." My thinking was that I had broken no law, had committed no crime, had endured physical torture and a month of illegal detention, and now they want me to sign an unfair demolition agreement against my conscience — I will never agree to that. I told them either to formally arrest me or release me without conditions. When they failed to break me, they left. That afternoon, Dongjian Police officers came to release us. They demanded I sign a document fraudulently recategorizing my month-long criminal detention as merely ten days of administrative [8] — a deliberate falsification designed to shield them from accountability for their unlawful actions. I refused to sign unless provided with my own copy of this record. They readily agreed to this condition to secure my signature, but immediately reneged once I had signed. Even when I pursued administrative litigation to obtain this document, they stonewalled me completely, with the police station claiming it was an "internal document" available only for court review, not for personal possession.

const chineseText = `我是江苏无锡锡山区羊尖镇的殷白妹。在2009年，我们羊尖镇政府把我们不在拆迁范围内的房屋强拆，至今已经16个年头，没有得到妥善解决。房子里上有老、下有小，居住了我们家四代同堂：老公的奶奶，我、老公和十几岁的女儿，老公的爸爸妈妈。我们家其实有两户，公公和老公的奶奶是一户，我夫妇三口是一户，但政府只肯合并为一户解决。

我家的房子前面有三层楼房，后面有三间也是楼房，只不过顶没有完全做好，有顶的部分是没有完整的三层二层。在中间还有一排房子，等于是三排房子。当时我们的房子跟我老公的哥哥是连排的。拆他哥哥家的房子时，把我们上面的房子也掀掉了几路瓦片。后来一下雨，我们上班回来发现家里漏水严重。我们不知道原因，还以为是楼板渗水了。后来电视机等家电家具都因漏水损坏了，我们自己爬到屋面上去看，发现屋面的瓦都被他们掀掉了三路。这是因为他们认定了反正之后也要来拆我们的房子，所以就很野蛮地拆迁。

我丈夫哥哥家拆掉之后，他们可以通过豁口闯进我家，分开多次进来恐吓骚扰。家里的东西只要他们能拿的，包括我们吃饭的灶上的东西，碗啊什么的，全部被他们拿走了。有一次他们趁我们不在家，把我们的围墙敲掉了。还有几次把门啊，窗啊，全部敲掉了。我们立刻报警，但是报警都没有用，警察不出警，即使出警也从来不肯做笔录。有一个星期天，趁我们夫妻两人去上班，只有我女儿学校放假一个人在家，拆迁公司的人敲掉五重门闯到我家里去，眼看着就要走到我女儿的房门。我女儿那个时候大约十六七岁，被他们弄出的动静惊醒。她虽然很害怕，还是勇敢地保护我们的家，跟他们去抢撬门的铁棍。村上还有一户邻居帮着给我们打电话，我们得以及时赶回去。

接下来他们故意把我们家附近的路都挖坏了。我老公开着中型拖拉机、拖着农用车，农用车上装着电瓶车，我们一家人才能够进出。因为那个时候他们要造西漳高速，但是我们家不在拆迁范围，是我们地方政府随意扩大拆迁范围。给我们停电停水是家常便饭，把我们的电线全部剪掉，只能插蜡烛照明。停水了我们就在自己家的井里打水。幸好我女儿那时候是住校的，只有周末回来两天，但老年人生活也很不方便。我们报警也没用，那个时候我们的感觉是叫天天不应，叫地地不灵，真的不知道自己是怎么生存下来的。

2008年7月5号，地方政府骗我老公在空白条款的协议 [1] 上签字，当时说好是按两户给我们赔偿四套房子。我们要问他们拿协议，他们说要敲好章再给我们，现在根本不给。他们就是等我们签字之后，就开始赖了，想要合并为一户拆迁，克扣我们两套补偿的房子。拆迁公司的人可怜我，给我提建议说如果他们不给我解决安置就不要搬走，所以我们就一直没走。我们多次去镇里和村里要求解决问题无果，在2009年1月8号，我第一次到锡山区人民政府信访办 [2] 去信访。我在那里哭，他们叫我回去，说"事情不解决，不会来拆你房子的"，但第二天1月9号就把我的房子强拆掉了。

2009年1月9日来强拆我们家房子的时候我不在家，村上的村民给我们打电话，说在拆你的房子了，我们就赶回去。我们到的时候屋面和屋顶已经没有了，全部被他们削掉了，就剩楼板没拆完。我不让他们拆，把我家的事情经过跟他们说，我说没有什么特别的诉求，我们是两户的，你们只要跟我们签合同的时候答应按照两户赔偿，兑现承诺，我就没事了。拆迁公司的人看我可怜，他就对我说："你躺到顶楼的楼板上去，看他们敢拆。"

我去躺在楼板上，但是我也顶不过他们，房子还是被强拆掉了。我报警了，但警察来了等于没来：他们不做笔录，每次来了一趟就走。有一个警察曾经跟我说，"你搬走吧，你再不走，我们也走不进来，你被他们打死我们都不知道了"。因为路面被破坏，警察到我们家附近也进不来，有一次天气下雨特别泥泞，警车开到现场又折回去，警察穿上了套鞋、雨鞋再来出警的。当时是一帮拆迁公司的人来拆的，不是村镇里的人。家里的东西，他们可以拿、想要的，包括灶上烧饭的锅碗瓢盆，全部被拿走了。我记得很清楚有一件冬天穿的棉袄，棉袄里藏了三千块钱现金，也被摸出来偷走了。房子拆了之后，我就跟我村上的一个村民一起住到我们村委会，睡在大厅里。后来村里的人来骗我说，"你的中型拖拉机肯定要赔你的，走，我带你到拆迁办去解决"。他带着我到拆迁办去，但并没有给我一个说法，等我从拆迁办回来，跟我一起去的村民已经被他们从村委会赶出来，大门已经紧闭了。

我心里很不服气，我就一直去村委会和镇里找他们。后来实在没办法了，我们就去拿了一套安置房，我们一家三个人住了进去。我老公的父母在别人厂里看门，就住在他们厂的门卫室。我为了要回自己的财产、到北京去上访，我拿的安置房刚装修好了，也被他们故意纵火烧掉了。安置房装修的时候我和我老公一直住在地下车库，后来要过年了我们就住到楼上去了。2010年十二月有一天半夜，我跟我老公睡梦中听见噼里啪啦的声音，起床就看见卫生间里烧起来了。二楼的邻居帮我们报警和火警，同一个楼层的邻居都来帮忙浇水救火。卫生间里的东西全部没用了，淋浴房和台盆等都烧掉了，外面的客厅等也全部被熏黑了。我们住的六楼是顶楼，上屋顶有一个天窗是任何人都能进来的，卫生间也有窗户可以往里面扔东西。事发以后，我走了好多部门，公安的大队长、中队长都来过我家。我们去楼顶上查看，发现屋顶上有脚印，他们也拍照取证了。我跟他们说，你们给我一个认定，是什么原因起火的？如果是电线起火，我们的电器都是新的，我可以去找厂家追究。后来他们换了一个大队长下来，他跟我说，这个火灾不是电线引起的，是人为引起的。我说那你们帮我查呀，就没有下文了。虽然我没有更多证据，但我猜测是因为我去上访、他们来放火恐吓、报复我。

后来我们夫妇俩为了要回自己的合法财产，年复一年一直坚持上访讨公道，向人大代表反映我们的诉求。2021年1月，我们到人民大会堂 [3] 门口的马路边上，我手里拿着自己的诉求，让老公给我拍一张照。拍的时候正好有几个其他访民看见了走过来，我们六个人就站着一起拍。回家之后1月22号我们就被监视居住 [4] 了。1月28号深夜，无锡市公安局梁溪分局迎龙桥派出所在没有出示任何手续的情况下把我老公从家里强行带走，手机被他们收走。他们找了锁匠来，撬锁前先敲了门。当时我就在旁边，眼看着有几十个人冲进来，拽着我的老公就走。我问他们拿手续，质问"你要抄家吗？"，他们拿不出手续，只有一个人拿出手机对着我晃了一下，我什么也没看到。我和他们扭起来，不让他们掳走我的丈夫，他们的车子停在楼下，我就拦着车子不让他们走，后来一路跟到迎龙桥派出所一直等到天亮。我女儿在我们家门口也被铐上脚铐，带到派出所。因为她年幼的儿子需要吃奶，我的嫂子和女婿开车到迎龙桥派出所讨要人，他们说没有抓我女儿，是羊尖派出所的人带走的。后来我嫂子抱着我的孙子到羊尖派出所，他们最终放了我女儿。但在那段时间正值冬天，我女儿需要上厕所时也不被允许，她只能尿在裤子里，他们也不给她换洗的衣物。那时我因为害怕他们会来抓我和我孙子，就带着他开始在外面流浪，不敢回家。在外流浪期间我们孙子确实吃了不少苦头。不能像在家里那样正常生活，孩子需要的纸尿裤等物品也很难保障，我们只能寄人篱下、四处奔波。

他们审问我丈夫，说我们在大会堂拍的照片被发到外网了，但我们并不知情。我丈夫到1月30号凌晨被放出来，带回一张监视居住的处罚单，一直到3月30号期间他都被看着不允许出门。那时正值疫情防控，后来实行"清零"政策 [5] 后，他们才允许我老公出去工作。我老公原本在工地上带领一帮人干活，被监视居住后无法去工作，造成了很多损失。他不在的这段时间，钢筋链接工作无人管理导致客户的工程需要返工，我老公的老板不得不赔偿客户的钱，这些损失都需要我们承担。

2021年5月28号，我老公到自己农田里去收麦子，村霸书记率领四个村干部把我老公团团围住、打倒在地，阻止他收割麦子。我老公两边的脸上全是伤痕，手也被打得肿得不得了，手机也被摔坏。在被卡住脖子几近窒息的情况下，我老公奋力反抗，咬了其中一名干部一口。于是他们就报警把我老公带到派出所，说我老公寻衅滋事 [6]，对他作出了罚款两百元的处罚，还要求他拘留八天，但最终没有执行拘留。但其实是他们寻衅滋事在先，我老公只是在自己的承包地里收麦子。5月29号，老公从派出所被放出来以后再次去收割麦子，村里的干部再次去阻拦，把他收好的麦子全部倒在地里烂掉，不准他拿回家。我向各个部门写了几十封紧急保护粮食申请书。在6月10号深夜，我们羊尖镇副书记和我们村委书记等人把我老公叫到村委，说要协商把这个麦子割掉。我老公要求他们要解决好事情，因为他之前割麦子都被强行阻拦。于是那天深夜，麦子被他们强行割掉了。

我们承包的土地是租自美城公司的，他们给了我们一封律师函，要求我们在6月21号前不交租金的话就把我们的田收回。6月20号，我没钱交租金，为了要活命生存，就到我常熟的哥哥家里去借钱。羊尖派出所的人尾随着我们去常熟，连夜把我哥的家包围住。到了6月21号天亮，他们就冲进来把我从我哥家里抓走。我侄女问他们拿搜查证，他们说有搜查证，但是等了好几个小时始终没有出示。他们把我哥家里的东西全部翻了个底朝天，就是为了要寻找我的手机。他们没有找到我手机，就把我哥也抓到常熟的张桥派出所，逼迫我拿手机去换放我哥出来。我说你们拿手续出来，我跟你们走，但是他们没有拿出来就强行把我抓走。6月21号下午我被送到迎龙桥派出所，周围都是请来的黑社会人员看守，直到晚上十点半左右，又把我带到羊尖派出所放出来。我询问他们关押我是什么事由，他们不肯回答，我不肯离开派出所，坚持向他们索要手续，他们才拿出了一张监视居住的处罚单，和我老公1月28号被抓后收到的一样。我认为监视居住和他们进我哥哥家里搜查根本是两码事情。

6月24号，我们夫妇俩为了生计，不顾他们的监视，坚持要到承包田里去种稻子，因为麦子都烂在田里以及被强行割走了，我们需要播种新的作物来维持生计。但是村委的人来阻止我们。我们报警了，警察叫他们在事情没有解决前都不准动。但是村委会根本不把警察放在眼里，警察说的话就当他放屁。从那天起至今，我们赖以生存的农田就被他们抢走。他们叫来外地的种田大户来鸠占鹊巢，他们至今还在耕种我们的地。6月27号，我们夫妇两个人被他们囚禁在家里不能走动，我女儿礼拜天放假，替我们去田边查看播种的稻子是否发芽，正好看到一辆中型拖拉机在把我们的田全部翻掉。后来被他们偷割掉的麦子的钱总算还给我了，但抢走我的田还是没有归还。我原来的房子拆除后变成了西漳高速公路附近的公园绿地，上面种了一些树，我如果到现场还能认得出我房子的地点。

我们到北京上访多年，被抓回来关黑监狱 [7] 无数次。2020年有一次被关在坊前信访院十天，我头痛欲裂、躺在床上爬不起来，原综治办主任带来了羊尖医院和锡山医院的医生来帮我量血压，也没有告诉我诊断结果。后来村委的人派来了一辆面包车，把我拉出去扔在我家门口，给我拍了一张照，也不顾我的生死就走了。后来幸亏邻居的帮忙，帮我打电话给在外面干活的老公，他回来后我叫他把我送到派出所，我说"我就算死也要死到派出所去"。后来派出所把我送到了羊尖医院，我才得知我的血压已经两百多了。这多次关押期间收到的摧残害得我现在终身服药。

2013年6月22号，无锡市另外一个维权人士丁红芬和她父亲等五个人从北京被押回来，关在锡山区安镇东郊商务宾馆。她电话请求我们去营救，我们也过去了，但是我们只是站在宾馆对面的绿化带看看、没有做什么事情。到后来我看着丁红芬被他们地方上的人抓走了，我们也各自回家了。到6月26号傍晚，去营救的人被陆续抓走，我在我家小区门口被羊尖派出所的一伙人抓上车子，关到滨湖区东绛和平宾馆里一个星期。期间我被扇耳光，导致我的耳朵受到了不可逆的损伤，不可能恢复到以前。他们对我这样刑讯逼供，就是要逼我承认我说22号那天是谁指使的，希望借此给我们的行为定性定罪。因为我不知道他们的内幕，我自己什么也没做、没看见，没办法顺着他们的意思作证。我说不出，他就不停地打我。我心里很害怕，被他们打得直哭，他们还不让我哭，如果我哭他们打我下手更重。

7月2号把我们当时在现场的12个人送到了无锡市看守所刑拘了一个月，我老公也被关了。在看守所里我也经历过被提审。到7月31号，羊尖派出所副所长带了一个人来跟我签协议，说，"殷白妹，你有没有想清楚了？想清楚了你就把这个协议签掉，我就带你回去"。我当时是这么想的，因为我从没犯过法，救人的那天我也没有做过违法的事情，你们殴打折磨我、非法把我拘押了一个月，现在又要叫我违心地来签不平等拆迁协议，我是不可能同意的，你们要么就把我逮捕。后来他们目的不成就走了。当天下午，我们也被东绛派出所的民警接出。民警叫我签了一张刑拘一个月只抵十天的行政拘留 [8]，把我刑拘一个月的事实歪曲成了行政拘留十天，他们的目的就是为了逃避自己的违法勾当。我不肯签，我说你要我签，除非把我签的这张纸给我。他满口答应，于是就逼我签了，但签下去后他们就不给我了。我通过行政诉讼去索要这份文件，他们也没有给我。派出所说这是他们内部的文件，只提供法院审查，不能给我本人。`;
